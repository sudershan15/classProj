Credit: Reuters/Brendan McDermid Mon Mar 19, 2012 11:51pm EDT (Reuters) - The chief executive of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide (HOT.N) said oil prices would have to rise "pretty significantly" from current levels to put a dent in hotel demand. Frits Van Paasschen said the current increase in oil prices reflects a U.S. and global economy that is gaining speed, a factor that bodes well overall for hotels. Starwood caters to higher-end customers with brands that include Sheraton, W and Westin. Oil prices rose on Friday, with Brent crude moving above $125 a barrel, as Iran oil supply worries and a weakening of the dollar on lesser chances of U.S. monetary policy tightening improved investor risk appetite for commodities. Van Paasschen said he wasn't overly concerned about oil price levels at the current time. "As we look at occupancy, not just in North America but around the world, it's quite strong today," van Paasschen said in a phone interview on Friday. "If oil prices were to go to unheard of levels, that might be a concern. If they rise even from where they are today, I'm not concerned," he added. Van Paasschen also said Starwood was not seeing signs of a slowdown in its China business. Starwood expects to open its 100th hotel in China this year and has an added 100 under construction in the country. China cut its growth target to an eight-year low recently and said boosting consumer demand was a key priority for 2012. "The Chinese economy by all accounts from what we see continues on robustly" in terms of development, demand and momentum in revenue per available room, an important hotel metric, van Paasschen said. He said an economy the size of China was likely to experience "fits and starts" as it grows. "Do I think it's a greater risk to be on the sidelines and miss this growth than live through those fits and starts? Absolutely," van Paasschen added.

India's NBCC fixes IPO price band at 90-106 rupees/share
| Reuters
MUMBAI, March 20 | Mon Mar 19, 2012 11:41pm EDT MUMBAI, March 20 (Reuters) - State-run National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) has fixed a price band of 90-106 rupees for its intial share sale that aims to raise up to 1.27 billion rupees ($25.3 million), it said in a newspaper advertisement on Tuesday. The government plans to sell a 10 percent stake in NBCC, which is a consultant for civil construction and real estate projects. Enam and IDBI Capital are the merchant bankers to the issue, which opens on March 22 and closes on March 27. The share sale will be the government's first since a $2.6 billion auction in Oil and Natural Gas Corp earlier this month failed to attract enough investors, forcing state-run Life Insurance Corp to pick up most of the 5 percent stake on offer.

Oprah Winfrey's OWN network lays off 30 in restructuring
| Reuters
Peter Lauria tells Oprah and Discovery to disown the $300 million investment that is the OWN network. With flat ratings, layoffs and the cancellation of "The Rosie Show," is there anything left to OWN?  Video  By Ronald Grover Mon Mar 19, 2012 11:40pm EDT (Reuters) - Oprah Winfrey's Network, OWN, the iconic talk show host's 15-month old cable network, has laid off 30 staffers after persistently poor ratings. A talk show hosted by comedienne Rosie O'Donnell, for example, was canceled after five months. The cable network, owned jointly by Winfrey and Discovery Communications, has had a hard time finding an audience for most of its programming after being launched on January 2, 2011. Discovery, which announced the layoffs in a regulatory filing, said it provided $312 million to start and operate the OWN, an amount that exceeded its $189 million commitment to the joint venture. Some of those funds were borrowed by the venture, the company also said. "Early results of OWN's operations have been below its initial business plan," Discovery added. "The economics of a start-up cable network just don't work with the cost structure that was in place," Winfrey said in a statement. "As CEO, I have a responsibility to chart the course for long-term success for the network." The staffers that were laid off are located in New York and Los Angeles, where the company has its production offices.

Credit: Reuters/Toru Hanai By Chikafumi Hodo and Nathan Layne KOBE/TOKYO | Mon Mar 19, 2012 11:39pm EDT KOBE/TOKYO (Reuters) - Tarumi Taxi in western Japan's port city of Kobe is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, offering a glimpse of the crisis facing tens of thousands of small and mid-sized companies across Japan with little hope of meeting their pension obligations. Owner Satoshi Nagata, 59, has been pressing banks for a loan before a deadline in September when a contractual trigger will quadruple the hole in the firm's pension account. Without it, Tarumi Taxi and its fleet of 40 cars and 80 drivers will likely fold. "We've been in the red every year since 2007. The additional funds needed for this pension installment is killing our business. I've sold everything from stocks to golf memberships to keep us afloat," said Nagata, sitting on a torn sofa on the second floor of the old wooden building that has served as company headquarters for half a century. "I'm talking with banks now in preparation to make the repayment by the end of August. But if I can't then we'll be in serious trouble." Nagata didn't invest in AIJ Investment Advisors, the Tokyo-based advisory firm at the centre of a $2 billion fraud that came to light late last month. But he says he knows why other pension funds struggling to meet the obligations for their growing ranks of retirees would. "We're not involved in AIJ but I can understand why they invested in this kind of high-yielding instrument," Nagata said. In one of Japan's worst financial scandals, AIJ is under investigation for falsifying performance records on roughly 200 billion yen ($2.4 billion) in pension money. Nearly all of that is believed to have disappeared, dealing a blow to the 84 pension co-operatives representing 880,000 employees that entrusted it with funds. The financial regulator, under fire for failing to prevent the scandal, has launched an investigation into all 265 discretionary asset managers in Japan. Politicians are considering regulations such as limiting risky investments and safety-net measures to support ailing pension funds. But new rules and inspections will do little to help the legions of pension funds already nursing big shortfalls and failing to meet annual return targets of up to 5.5 percent, realistic decades ago when they were set but no longer probable in an era of zero interest rates and deflation. Around a sixth of the 595 co-operatives that manage the bulk of the 27 trillion yen ($324 billion) in pension assets for small and medium-sized firms are designated by the health ministry to be in a state of critical financial health. As of March 2011, the collective shortfall was 630 billion yen. "For companies that fail to manage their assets well the pension becomes a huge weight on profitability," said Hitoshi Suzuki, chief researcher and pension system expert at Daiwa Institute of Research. "Reserve shortfalls tend to grow in a deflationary environment, which Japan has experienced for a long time. It's a serious structural problem." FALLING LIKE DOMINOES Tarumi Taxi is a cautionary tale of the knock-on impact of winding down a troubled pension fund. The current corporate pension system dates back to the 1960s when the government allowed companies to borrow a portion of the national employee pension fund to leverage their investments, a system that worked well before 1990 when Japan's bubble economy and share prices collapsed. In the aftermath mostly large companies with the financial strength to pay back the borrowed portion did so because this allowed them to either dissolve their pension funds, lower the payout target or switch to a 401K-style defined contribution scheme. These changes put the burden of managing the pension on the employees themselves. "Bigger companies have the ability to allocate more funds to the pension reserves and pay back the government portion. But small companies cannot do this. This is a problem for society," said Tsutomu Okubu, a lawmaker in the ruling Democratic Party and a member of a task force tackling the issue. As a result the number of pension funds dropped dramatically, and most of those remaining are co-operatives too weak financially to return the borrowed portion to the state. They are made up of groups of companies in the same industry like gasoline stands, printing shops or the Hyogo prefecture taxi pension fund to which Tarumi Taxi belongs. In 2006, the Hyogo taxi co-operative decided to bite the bullet and pay back the 7 billion yen it owed to the state scheme. Of the 50 companies in the fund, 21 had the ability to pay off their share in a lump sum, ending their obligations. The remaining 29 opted for installments stretched over 10 years at about 15 million yen per year, a tidy sum for a small taxi firm. In 2007, the first company went bankrupt, leaving an increased burden for the remaining 28. By the end of last month another 14 had gone under. It is the first known string of bankruptcies triggered by the dissolution of a pension co-operative, according to Tokyo Shoko, a bankruptcy research firm. Tarumi Taxi needs to raise about 100 million yen by August to wipe the slate clean. If it fails to meet that deadline its burden will automatically ratchet up to 440 million yen as it would be required to foot the bill for a larger number of failed members. This would surely bankrupt his firm, Nagata says. Similar crises could play out among any of the more than 200 pension co-operatives that are in the red on the government portion of their pension assets, warned Tokyo Shoko analyst Kunio Hashimoto. "In the future they are likely candidates for dissolution, and the situation could develop along the lines of Hyogo taxi," Hashimoto says. "That's just how grave this problem is." HEALTH WARNING With an investment strategy centered on Nikkei options and other derivatives, AIJ had boasted to prospective clients late last year that the cumulative returns since 2002 of a flagship Cayman-based fund had reached 245 percent. Some funds allocated more than 30 percent of their assets with AIJ, attracted by the convincing sales pitch of president Kazuhiko Asakawa, whose status as a former branch manager at Nomura Securities lent him credibility. "Many sales people got in contact with us to offer us new products. But I have to admit that Asakawa's explanation simply stood out," said one pension manager who invested in the flagship AIM Millennium fund. Among steps being weighed to prevent another AIJ-type scandal, the health ministry is looking at limiting the percentage of a pension fund's assets invested with any one adviser, while the financial regulator is considering reclassifying pension funds as non-professional investors to give them greater protection under the law. Okubo wants to introduce a Japanese version of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) to clarify the fiduciary responsibilities of all parties involved in pension management. In Japan, where many pension funds are run by financial novices, this accountability is unclear. This issue is at the heart of a 26 billion yen ($312 million) lawsuit brought by a pension cooperative of gasoline stand owners on the southern island of Kyushu against Resona Trust & Banking Co in 2010. The Kyushu pension claims Resona breached its fiduciary duty in steering most of its assets into highly leveraged property funds without properly explaining the risks. The property tumbled in value after the financial crisis in 2008, triggering massive losses. A spokesman for Resona said the bank would not comment on an ongoing case.

New York Republican wins key 3rd-party nod in Senate bid

See the best of Reuters photography.  See more | Photo caption  A look at the legal battles and the controversies over gay marriage.  Slideshow  Peru declares a health alert after hundreds of birds and dolphins wash up dead in the past few months.  Slideshow  By Edith Honan NEW YORK | Mon Mar 19, 2012 11:33pm EDT NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York's Conservative Party nominated a strong social and fiscal conservative, Wendy Long, as its Senate candidate on Monday -- handing Long's Republican Party bid a significant boost but also threatening to divide Republican voters. The endorsement from the small but influential party was a coveted prize sought by all three Republican candidates, who will face off in a June 26 primary. The winner of that race will run as the GOP candidate in November U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, in a bid to be the first Republican to win a senatorial contest in New York since 1992. Long, a New York City lawyer who once clerked for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, described herself as a committed conservative who would bring a clear contrast in a race against Gillibrand, whom she called a "rubber-stamp" for President Barack Obama. "I've got some news for the senator: she has maxed out her credit with New Yorkers and her Washington spending spree is about to end," said Long, adding that she would vote to repeal Obama's health care package, support tax cuts and would push for an overhaul of the country's energy policy. Asked if she would remain in the race -- running on the conservative party's ballot line --even if she were to lose the Republican party primary, Long said she would. "I promised the conservatives that I'm in the race till November, and I'm in the race till November," said Long. The two other Republican candidates are Representative Bob Turner, who last year won an upset victory to fill New York City's congressional seat left vacant when Anthony Weiner resigned in a sex scandal, and Nassau County Comptroller George Maragos. Both appeared the Conservatives' meeting on Monday. The nomination was somewhat unexpected since the Conservative Party chairman, Michael Long, has shared a decades-long friendship with Turner and was a key backer last year when Turner decided to run for congress. Turner's upset win last September against a well-known Democrat in a district where Democrats outnumber Republicans three to one garnered national headlines and was seen as a referendum on Obama's economic and foreign policies. But the victory was short-lived: this month, the district became a casualty in the state's once-per-decade redrawing of district lines. It was only then that Turner decided to enter the Senate race. "In New York, (Republicans) have a ... registration disadvantage. I've been able to overcome that, and I intend to do that again," Turner told reporters on Monday. Chairman Long, who is not related to Wendy Long, said the decision, which he said caused him "heartache," came down to Turner entering the race too late. "Not only did he come to the table too late... (Wendy Long) stands, head and shoulders, in all honesty, as a stronger candidate than he does," the party chairman said. "We're not in the business of just letting people rearrange the deck chairs." Monday also marked the state's Democratic party's nominating convention, where Democrats formally threw their support behind Gillibrand to win re-election and her first full six-year term. Gillibrand was appointed to fill the Senate seat vacated in 2009 by Hillary Clinton, who was named Obama's Secretary of State. The following year Gillibrand won a special election to fill the remainder of the term with a commanding 63 percent of the vote. Democratic Party chairman Jay Jacobs said he would welcome a race against any of Gillibrand's potential opponents, saying all of them are too conservative to appeal to New York voters. "For all three of them, they'd be more successful in a different state in a different century." he said. A January poll by the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion found 44 percent of registered voters were unsure which candidate they would vote for. Fewer than four in ten registered voters said they would "definitely" back Gillibrand, while 18 percent said they planned to vote against her, the poll found. Marist has not done a poll of the Republican field. "I think the best thing she's got going for her is that this will be a presidential election year, turnout will be higher in New York, and the higher the turn-out the better the Democratic advantage in New York," said Marist pollster Lee Miringoff. Republicans have not won a Senate race in New York since 1992, when Alfonse D'Amato narrowly beat Robert Abrams to earn a third term. D'Amato, however, lost his bid for a fourth term in 1998 to Charles Schumer.

Sun Hung Kai executive arrested over suspected bribery

Credit: Reuters/Bobby Yip/Files Mon Mar 19, 2012 11:31pm EDT (Reuters) - A senior executive at Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd (0016.HK) has been arrested by Hong Kong's anti-graft body over suspected bribery, in a rare case involving Asia's largest property developer by market value. The Hong Kong-based company, run by brothers and joint chairmen Thomas and Raymond Kwok, said Thomas Chan Kui-yuen had informed it that he had been arrested by Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) in relation to allegations of bribery. The Kwoks are Hong Kong's second-richest family, according to Forbes magazine, with a net worth of $18.3 billion. Chan, an executive director at the company, was responsible for project planning and land acquisitions. The arrest "has not affected and will not affect" the normal business and operations of the company, the developer said in a statement late on Monday. The board has set up a special committee to handle the ICAC investigation, the statement added. It did not list the amount of money involved in the probe. A spokesman for the company said on Tuesday that it had no further details to add. One analyst, who did not want to be identified given the sensitive nature of the allegations, said there had not been a similar case at a major Hong Kong developer since the analyst started covering the sector 15 years ago. Shares of Sun Hung Kai, which has a market value of around $39 billion, slipped 1.5 percent at the start of trade in Hong Kong on Tuesday morning, with the benchmark Hang Seng index down 0.3 percent. According to a Reuters database, Chan, 65, has worked at Sun Hung Kai for 25 years and has been a director since 1987. Sun Hung Kai develops property in Hong Kong and mainland China and holds a portfolio of office space including Hong Kong's tallest building, the International Commerce Centre. Sun Hung Kai Properties in February reported an underlying profit of HK$11.8 billion ($1.52 billion) for the fiscal first half ended December 31, up 13 percent from a year earlier, slightly exceeding expectations. The number of property deals in Hong Kong fell 33.1 percent in 2011 from the previous year as the government imposed a series of measures to stamp out property speculation and cool the city's housing market.
