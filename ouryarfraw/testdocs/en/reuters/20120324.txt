Text:UPDATE 4-Cheney gets heart transplant, in intensive care
| Reuters
Sat Mar 24, 2012 11:56pm EDT * Cheney has had five heart attacks from age 37 * Has been on heart transplant list more than 20 months * 75 percent of transplant recipients survive 5 years (Adds reaction, background) By Phil Stewart WASHINGTON, March 24 (Reuters) - Former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney was recovering on Saturday after undergoing heart transplant surgery, a once risky procedure whose survival rates have improved over the years. The 71-year-old Republican, who wielded unprecedented power as vice president during the George W. Bush administration's war on terrorism, was in the intensive care unit at Inova Fairfax Hospital in Falls Church, Virginia. Cheney, who has suffered five heart attacks, the first at age 37, had been on the cardiac transplant list for more than 20 months before he received the heart from an anonymous donor. "Although the former vice president and his family do not know the identity of the donor, they will be forever grateful for this lifesaving gift," the spokeswoman, Kara Ahern, said. According to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, about 88 percent survive the first year after heart transplant surgery and 75 percent survive for five years. The 10-year survival rate is about 56 percent. Cheney's transplant followed a series of procedures in recent years to extend the use of his heart. Cheney had bypass surgery in 1988 and later had two angioplasties. In 2001, he had a defibrillator implanted in his chest. He had a heart pump implanted in 2010 to compensate for worsening "end-stage" congestive heart failure. He said after the operation he was considering whether to seek a full heart transplant.  WAITLIST During Cheney's eight years as vice president from 2001 to 2009, he pushed a "go it alone" world view that enraged his critics and dogged him long after he left public life. Cheney was a strong advocate for the 2003 invasion of Iraq and was among the most outspoken of Bush administration officials warning of the danger from Iraq's suspected stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. No such weapons were found. In recent years, Cheney has appeared increasingly frail in public. Data kept by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network show that 316 people were waiting for a heart donor in the region two, which includes Virginia and Washington D.C., as of March 16. Many concerns about heart transplants with older recipients have eased over the years. Some 332 people age 65 and over received heart transplants nationwide last year, more than 13 times the number in 1988, according to data from the network. The facility where Cheney's operation was performed said on its website that its surgeons performed the Washington region's first successful heart transplant in 1986. The world's first human heart transplant was performed in South Africa in 1967, but the patient survived less than three weeks. Before becoming vice president, Cheney was defense secretary in the George H. W. Bush administration and served a stint as President Gerald Ford's White House chief of staff in the 1970s. Former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich, who is waging a struggling Republican bid for president, said Cheney was in his "thoughts and prayers tonight." "He has been a colleague and friend for many years, and we are glad that the surgery went well," Gingrich said a statement.

Canada's NDP elects new leader, urges unity

Credit: Reuters/Mike Cassese By Julie Gordon TORONTO | Sat Mar 24, 2012 11:47pm EDT TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's main opposition party chose heavily favored candidate Thomas Mulcair to replace the late Jack Layton, who died of cancer just three months after leading the leftist party to its strongest ever performance in a federal election. Mulcair, a former Quebec cabinet minister who is a relative newcomer to the New Democratic Party (NDP), took over the reins after four rounds of voting at the leadership convention, held in downtown Toronto on Friday and Saturday. The Montreal lawmaker, who advocated the party reach beyond its traditional base to appeal to centrist voters, led all four votes of the day, eventually trouncing runner-up Brian Topp, who campaigned to keep the party squarely left-of-center. "Today we have the greatest human capacity, and the greatest potential to put that capacity to work than at any time in our history," said Mulcair to the crowd of cheering delegates. "Our future is limitless, if we get our priorities right." "The challenge that confronts us is not a failure of ability or talent, it is a failure of leadership and that is failure that we intend to reverse." Mulcair will now take on the tough job of building on gains made by Layton and proving to Canadians that the traditionally third-place party can defeat Prime Minister Stephen Harper's right-of-center Conservatives in the 2015 election. That's a tall order, partly because the unprecedented surge in NDP votes in the 2011 election was based largely on the drawing power of Layton, sometimes dubbed Smiling Jack. With rifts caused by the sometimes divisive leadership race threatening to destabilize the party, the official message at the weekend convention was one of unity and driving forward to form the Canada's next government. "They told us, before the last election, that it couldn't be done, but we rolled up our sleeves and proved them wrong," said Nycole Turmel in her final speech as the party's interim leader. "At every step we have proven them wrong. And today we are just as united and determined as ever." Dislodging the Conservatives may not require actually winning more seats in the House of Commons, but rather holding them to less than half and then trying to form a coalition with the other minority parties. Currently the Conservatives have 165 of 308 seats, or 11 more than half, and the NDP has 102. HOLDING ON IN QUEBEC But with just over 62,000 members casting ballots in the third round from nearly 130,000 eligible voters across the country, the low turnout had Canadian media speculating that the NDP could be losing support. This is a particular risk in the French-speaking province of Quebec, where voters are notoriously fickle and have already started deserting the party and returning to the separatist Bloc Quebecois in public opinion polls. "What the leadership absolutely needs is someone who can keep the momentum that the NDP gained in Quebec, someone that Quebecois voters can connect to on a personal and political level," said Kris Nelson, a new party member from Quebec. Mulcair, one of 10 children born to an Irish-Canadian father and French-Canadian mother, was a provincial environment minister for the Liberal party and in 2007 became the NDP's second-ever member of Parliament from Quebec. The party also faces a tough challenge competing with others on the left, including the Liberal Party, the Green Party and, in Quebec, the Bloc Quebecois. This has led to calls by some in the NDP and Liberals to merge, or at least cooperate in the next election, an idea Mulcair has rejected. Voting was delayed on Saturday afternoon, as suspected hackers attacked the computer system that allowed party members to cast their ballots online. "It was a question of overwhelming our system to make it harder for people to access the site to vote," party president Rebecca Blaikie told reporters, adding: "The auditors have no concern about the security of the vote." Blaikie said all members had the opportunity to cast their ballots and an investigation over the attack was underway. The voting period was repeatedly extended throughout the day as the online ballot system struggled to keep up with users. All counted, in the final ballot Mulcair walked away with 33,881 votes, or 57.2 percent, compared with Topp's 42.8 percent of the vote. In Canada's 2011 federal elections, the New Democrats smashed all expectations, almost trebling its seats in the House of Commons and becoming the main opposition party for the first time ever. The governing Conservatives - who favor low taxes and a tough-on-crime approach - won a majority of seats in the House of Commons in the May 2 election and will not face reelection until October 2015.

Santorum wins Louisiana, flexing Southern muscle

Credit: Reuters/Darren Hauck By Ros Krasny and Samuel P. Jacobs NEW ORLEANS | Sat Mar 24, 2012 11:26pm EDT NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Rick Santorum cruised to victory in the Louisiana Republican presidential primary on Saturday but still trails Mitt Romney by a wide margin in the national delegate count for the party nomination. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, was projected to finish second. Former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich was third, but immediately rejected suggestions he should drop out. Texas congressman Ron Paul ran fourth. Santorum had strong support in all income groups except for the very wealthy, and solid backing from conservative and religious voters in the Deep South state. "The people of Louisiana sent a loud and clear message - this race is far from over," Santorum said in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where he watched the election results after making a series of campaign stops. Santorum, a socially conservative former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, has done well in the Deep South, winning Mississippi and Alabama earlier this month. In all, Santorum has won seven state contests in March. Saturday's primary allocated only 20 of Louisiana's 46 total Republican delegates as candidates spar for the right to take on Democratic President Barack Obama in the November general election. The rest of the delegates will be allocated at the state party convention in June. With 91 percent of the precincts reporting, Santorum had 49 percent of the vote, Romney 26 percent and Gingrich 16 percent. If those totals hold, Santorum and Romney would both gain delegates from Louisiana, with Gingrich shut out. Exit polls showed that 47 percent of Republican primary voters identified themselves as "very conservative," and of those Santorum beat Romney by 52 percent to 24 percent. Santorum also won majorities among voters calling themselves "somewhat conservative" or "moderate," and those who said that religion matters a lot in public life. A Republican candidate needs 1,144 delegates to secure the party's nomination. CNN's current delegate count puts Romney well ahead, with 563 delegates to Santorum's 259. VOTER TURNOUT LOW Exit polls showed voters in Louisiana, which has a relatively low 6.9 percent unemployment rate but also low median income, were most concerned about the economy and the budget deficit. The state has been hammered economically in the past decade, first by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and then by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Still, Santorum found backing from the state's many Christian evangelicals. Louisiana also has a large block of Roman Catholic voters who, as a group, are regarded as more conservative than Catholics in many other states. "He's a Christian man. I like many of the things he says, about gasoline prices, and healthcare. He's for everything I'm for," said Ronald Moore, 78, a retired commercial contractor from Monroe. Voter turnout at many precincts was low, according to election officials, even though state Republican leaders had hoped that having the nomination still in the balance would boost turnout. All four remaining Republican candidates visited Louisiana in the days leading up to the vote. Gingrich spent a week here, crisscrossing the state from Shreveport in the northwest to Port Fourchon on the Gulf of Mexico, pushing a plan for increased energy production that he said could lower U.S. gasoline prices. Despite his poor performance, Gingrich vowed to stay in the race as he attempts to play the role of spoiler to Romney's presidential ambitions. "This is clearly still an open race," Gingrich said in an emailed statement. "I will carry our solution oriented campaign to (the Republican convention in) Tampa." The next showdown in the Republican nominating contest will be in Wisconsin on April 3. Maryland and the District of Columbia also vote that day. Santorum has pledged to stay in the race until the party's convention in August, and is likely to take heart from results in March, a month when he has won seven state contests despite failing to chip away at Romney's delegate lead. For Romney, Louisiana's results suggest that he continues to struggle with the most conservative element of the Republican Party, some of whom distrust his Mormon religion and history of changing positions on social issues. "Mitt Romney would be really good at creating jobs, but the pro-life issue is one of my main things," said Cheryl Stephens, 56, of Monroe. Exit polls showed that a now-infamous comment this week by a Romney aide, that the election could be reset like an Etch-A-Sketch after the primaries, might have given Santorum a late lift. Santorum and Gingrich made frequent campaign appearances brandishing the popular toy, and chiding Romney for what they said were his inconsistent positions. Nineteen percent of voters said the comment was "important" to their vote, and of those, 60 percent went for Santorum.

'Cash Mobs' gather to splurge in locally owned stores
| Reuters
By Kim Palmer CLEVELAND, Ohio, March 24 | Sat Mar 24, 2012 11:13pm EDT CLEVELAND, Ohio, March 24 (Reuters) - Flash mobs have been blamed as a factor in looting during urban riots. But now a group of online activists is harnessing social media like Twitter and Facebook to get consumers to spend at locally owned stores in cities around the world in so-called Cash Mobs. At the first International Cash Mob day on Saturday, wallet- toting activists gathered in as many as 200 mobs in the United States and Europe, with the aim of spending at least $20 a piece in locally owned businesses, according to the concept's founder, Cleveland lawyer Andrew Samtoy. "It's my baby but I'm not a helicopter parent," Samtoy told a crowd of more than 100 people gathered Saturday at Nature's Bin, a grocery store that specializes in local and organic food, in Lakewood, an inner ring suburb of Cleveland. The 32-year-old dreamed up the Cash Mob idea last year after spending time in Britain during summer riots that unleashed looting in cities including London, Manchester and Birmingham. His first Cash Mob, in Cleveland last November, brought around 40 shoppers packing in to the Visible Voice book shop, on a welcome spree in which each of them spent on average $40 within an hour-and-a-half. "We are kind of slow in November so I wasn't going to turn it down," said the independent book store's owner, Dave Ferrante, who estimated he made about eight times his normal take on that day. "We have a very limited marketing budget and it brought in people who wouldn't have been here. It sounds corny but we really build a base one customer at a time," he added. After the original Cash Mob in Cleveland, Samtoy's Facebook friends in other cities picked up on the idea and organized their own gatherings. Samtoy can rattle off a list of friends from Los Angeles to Boston who were the 'early adapters' of the Cash Mob phenomenon. MEET PEOPLE, SPEND AND HAVE FUN As well as the spree in Cleveland on Saturday, gatherings also took place in Kansas City and New York. Reuters was unable to verify independently if community shoppers splurged in other U.S. cities and worldwide. Samtoy's approach is to target one location bringing as many people to one site as possible but other cities have taken a different approach. "There is no science to it and there are also no hard and fast rules," he explains. He told the group gathered in Cleveland that he only has three rules or goals as he explains them: "You have to spend at least $20, meet three people you never met before and have fun." Cash Mob participant Amy Marke, from Independence, Ohio, came with her cousin because she wanted to support local businesses and was drawn to this event because the store does vocational training for disabled adults. "I never do anything spur of the moment or crazy like this but I heard about it and had to come," she said. Kelly Ziegler, co-founder of the Cash Mob movement in Kansas City, Missouri, told Reuters activists planned flash spending sprees in nine different locations around the metro area on Saturday. "Kansas City is really spread out. We have a really strong following on Facebook and there were calls for cash mobs at all of these areas. There are so many shops to hit we thought 'why not hit a lot all at once?'" "I grew up in a family with a small business. I know these small businesses can't afford a million dollar ad campaign. When you spend $1 at these local stores that stays in the community," she added. And in Brooklyn, New York, activists noted how easy they are to organize. "It really doesn't take a lot of effort," said Park Slope Cash Mob organizer, Amy Cortese, author of 'Locavesting: The Revolution in Local Investing and How to Profit From it.' With a large number of locally owned businesses and a culture of entrepreneurship in Brooklyn she says it only made sense to get behind the Cash Mob movement. "It is surprising that no one had thought to do this before," she added.

Korea Q2 mfg business sentiment rebounds: survey
| Reuters
SEOUL | Sat Mar 24, 2012 11:09pm EDT SEOUL (Reuters) - Business sentiment among South Korean manufacturers in the second quarter snapped a nearly two-year-long slide to pick up from the previous three months, a private survey showed on Sunday. The rebound boded well for Asia's fourth-largest economy, but the index stayed below a point separating improvement from deterioration for a third consecutive quarter, the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry data showed. The manufacturers' business sentiment index rebounded to 99 for the April-June period from 77 for the first quarter. This marked the first rise since the second quarter of 2010 and the highest level since the third quarter of 2011. Still, the latest reading came below 100 because companies expecting deterioration in their business activity for the coming quarter outnumbered those predicting improvement. The country's largest business lobby group said in the statement unstable political conditions in the Middle East and high global crude oil prices were cited by companies as the biggest risks to economic recovery. The group, which represents more small to medium-sized companies than large conglomerates, said it had surveyed 2,500 manufacturers across the country from February 23 to March 8.

The region's foreign ministers and members of the Central American Integration System (SICA) will meet in Antigua on Saturday to discuss the decriminalization of drugs and other alternatives in the fight against drug trafficking. Credit: Reuters/William Gularte By Mike McDonald ANTIGUA, Guatemala | Sat Mar 24, 2012 11:01pm EDT ANTIGUA, Guatemala (Reuters) - Guatemalan President Otto Perez on Saturday set out a raft of proposals to tackle rampant drug-fuelled violence in Central America, including decriminalization of narcotics or establishing a regional court to try traffickers. "The proposal is decriminalization," Perez said at a regional summit to address security throughout the region. "We are talking about creating a legal framework to regulate the production, transit and consumption of drugs." The discussion reflects growing concern in Central America about the cost of the war on drugs, which is prompting leaders to take an increasingly independent line from the United States, where officials have repeatedly rejected legalizing narcotics. A retired general, Perez won election in November 2011 promising to crack down on organized crime. But he shifted from his hard-line message shortly after taking office in January, calling for a more open debate on drug policy. "It's important this is on the discussion table as an alternative to what we've been doing for 40 years without getting the desired results," he said, noting that decriminalization would erode drug cartels' profits. The president added that Central American leaders are considering requiring the United States, the biggest consumer of South American cocaine, to pay the region for drug raids. "We're talking about economic compensation for every seizure undertaken and also the destruction of marijuana and cocaine plantations," said Perez, a 61-year-old conservative. Guatemala's murder rate has nearly doubled since 2000 due in part to brutal Mexican drug cartels extending their reach south. In May 2011, the feared Zetas gang beheaded 27 farm workers in northern Guatemala in a dispute with the farm's owner over cocaine moving from South America to the United States. Another alternative Central American leaders are mulling is setting up a court with jurisdiction for the region that would hear crimes related to the drug trade like kidnapping, contract killing, and trafficking of people and arms, Perez added. "This would give breathing space to the justice system because it would relieve pressure on our courts," he said, adding that the court would have its own penal system. CAUGHT IN THE SANDWICH Regional leaders in countries affected by drug violence have called for more open debate on other solutions to the problem. Mexican President Felipe Calderon, to whom Perez has turned for advice on confronting the cartels, has called on Washington to take more responsibility for reducing demand for drugs, and has said he is open to debates about legalization. Calderon has been mired in a costly struggle since he launched an army-led crackdown on the drug gangs shortly after taking office in late 2006. Drug violence has spiked since then, claiming some 50,000 lives in Mexico. Colombian President Juan Santos, whose country produces much of the cocaine shipped north, has also demanded a new approach. Washington has defended the war on drugs and in recent visits to the region U.S. Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano rejected Perez's legalization pitch, citing a fall in Colombia's murder rate. Perez, the founder of Guatemala's right-wing Patriot Party, said Central America was paying too heavy a price for the war. "Our countries are not producers or consumers of drugs," he said. "We are in the middle of the sandwich." In the past two months alone, Guatemala has confiscated more than 1,000 kilos (2,200 pounds) of cocaine valued at roughly $10,000 per kilo, and destroyed nearly $1 billion worth of poppy plants. (Editing by Dave Graham and Eric Beech)  Prohibition has finally run its course; our prisons are full, our economy is in ruins, the lives and livelihoods of tens of millions of Americans have been destroyed or severely disrupted, and what was once a shining beacon of liberty and prosperity has become a toxic, repressive, smoldering heap of hypocrisy and a gross affront to fundamental human decency. It is now the duty of every last one of us to insure that the people who are responsible for this shameful situation are not simply left in peace to enjoy the wealth and status that their despicable actions have, until now, afforded them.

Korea Q2 mfg business sentiment rebounds - survey

This marked the first rise since the second quarter of 2010 and the highest level since the third quarter of 2011. Still, the latest reading came below 100 because companies expecting deterioration in their business activity for the coming quarter outnumbered those predicting improvement. The country's largest business lobby group said in the statement unstable political conditions in the Middle East and high global crude oil prices were cited by companies as the biggest risks to economic recovery. The group, which represents more small to medium-sized companies than large conglomerates, said it had surveyed 2,500 manufacturers across the country from Feb. 23 to March 8.

Wade fell short of a majority in the February 26 vote with 34.8 percent. Sall came second with 26.6 percent. The first-round candidates have now united behind Sall as has civil society group M-23, which has been calling on Wade, 85, to step down. Campaigning for the second-round vote has been incident free after at least six people were killed in protests before the first round. Wade hopes to extend his 12 years in power by wooing the many Senegalese who did not vote in February and by courting religious leaders who wield strong influence in the majority Muslim country. Poverty and mass unemployment remain the two main grievances against Wade, who came to power in 2000. He argues that he has done more than the rival Socialists did in the 40 years they ruled since independence from France in 1960. Wade said during his last campaign rally in Dakar on Friday: "Poverty has been wiped out of Senegal, but I do not deny that there are some pockets in major cities. I'll take care of it after the elections." Campaigning has been dominated by the row over Wade's legal right to seek a third term in one of Africa's stable democracies. His bid was endorsed by a Constitutional Council whose head he appointed. Many voters now view Wade, elected enthusiastically in 2000, as yet another example of a long-serving African leader seeking to hang on to power. DISPUTED RESULTS? Sall's manifesto includes a revamp of Senegal's outage-prone energy sector and renewed efforts to end a simmering rebellion in the southern Casamance region, once a tourist hotspot. Sall, 50, is also hoping to lure voters with a promise to cut taxes on basics, such as rice, in a country where rising food costs mean some households spend half their income to ensure a daily communal bowl of rice and sauce. Both candidates have said they cannot envisage defeat in the run-off, paving the way for a possible dispute when results come in on Monday or Tuesday, and a possible resumption of street protests. There are more than five million registered voters. Samir Gadio, London-based emerging markets analyst at Standard Bank, said the market had been negative on Senegal's $500 million Eurobond before the first round vote due to the deteriorating political and security climate. "The smooth electoral process since and the possibility of an orderly transition in coming days would boost Senegal's historical reputation of political stability," Gadio said in a note, adding this sentiment was now shifting short-term risks to the bond's yield outlook to the downside. "The main stress point is obviously whether both parties will immediately accept the outcome of Sunday's contest," he said.
