Text:Investors grapple with higher wages in low-cost China
| Reuters
By Lucy Hornby and Don Durfee BEIJING, March 26 | Sun Mar 25, 2012 11:57pm EDT BEIJING, March 26 (Reuters) - U.S. lawnmower manufacturer Briggs & Stratton is used to worrying about turnover - just not the human kind. Like many foreign investors in China, the Milwaukee-based firm has been hit by a steady rise in wages for the white collar employees who staff China's shiny new office towers. After decades of aggressive expansion in China, foreign employers like Briggs & Stratton face a relative shortage of experienced, English-speaking engineers and managers - and find it increasingly expensive to recruit and retain good staff. Rather than waiting around for extra digits on their paychecks, China's workers are creating their own pay raises by jumping ship at the slightest temptation. "Turnover is a huge issue for anyone in China. Our turnover is 9 to 10 percent," said Mark Plum, Asia president for Briggs & Stratton in Shanghai. He added that in Shanghai, turnover rates were generally around 18 to 20 percent. "Anywhere else you'd say that was terrible. Here, it's not half bad." On the factory floor as well, cheap labour no longer looks limitless, prompting manufacturers to consider moving from the country's prosperous coast to poorer, cheaper inland regions. Some are even taking their lowest-margin, most labour-intensive operations to other countries altogether, such as Vietnam. Employees and wages now top the preoccupations of American investors in China, according to the American Chamber of Commerce annual business-climate survey, released on Monday. "Management-level human resource constraints" ranked as the biggest business challenge in the survey, cited by 43 percent of respondents compared with 30 percent last year. "Non-management level" constraints were ranked third. Labour costs ranked as the third greatest challenge, after an economic slowdown in China and the wider global economy. In a similar survey released by the chamber in Shanghai last month, 90 percent of respondents saw rising costs as a hindrance to businesses. About the same number said finding skilled labour was a challenge. "There's been an absolute explosion of consciousness of this issue," said Kim Woodard, of consultancy InterChina. "It's not just because the media have covered it but also in internal budgets they are seeing a 20 percent rise in wages."  FOUR COMPANIES IN TWO YEARS Government statistics show that average monthly urban wages rose by 13.3 percent between 2009 and 2010, although companies' actual cost structures can vary considerably. As the number of adults flowing into the workforce slows, China can no longer attract manufacturing with the promise that an unending pool of rural migrants will keep its wages down. InterChina used to build in simple wage rises of 5 to 8 percent a year when helping clients carry out feasibility studies for new operations in China, Woodard said. That calculation is now a lot more complicated, with investors having to weigh China costs against Vietnam or India. Rising Chinese wages will surpass those of Mexico in about five years, he estimated, giving Mexican factories an advantage when exporting to the U.S. market. Unlike the supply of manual labourers, the number of college graduates is rising steeply. But companies often complain that graduates with the right skills and experience are hard to find, and expensive to keep. An engineer with up to five years' experience can be hired for $9,500-$20,000 in China, says recruitment firm J.M. Gemini. This doesn't mean that jobs will flow back to the United States - the average salary of a worker in Milwaukee is $33,140 a year, far above China levels. While Briggs & Stratton's 3,000 employees in the United States are probably keenly aware that America's manufacturing base is shrinking, Chinese graduates often view their current job simply as a springboard to the next one. "What happens here is that you get a young person who speaks pretty good English and has worked for two to four years. If the guy is under 30, he may have worked for four companies in just two years," Plum said. "In the States, you'd never hire the guy because you'd say he can't hold down a job. Here you just have to say well, that's how it is." Briggs & Stratton, which also makes snow-blowers and other small engines, employs mechanical engineers in China as well as people to figure out how to price and market products. It runs a factory outside Shanghai, one of five international facilities. According to its website, "Briggs & Stratton believes there is an engine inside everyone that drives him or her forward". In China, it is forced to fuel that engine with team-building exercises to keep employees loyal, such as taking staff to outdoor sports events or on overnight company retreats. "As a company, we're not used to having to keep people entertained," Plum said. "If you get laid off in Milwaukee, there's no jobs - so no one leaves the job they have. Here, if you get laid off or leave, there's a hundred jobs."

Olympics-Triathlon champion Snowsill's London defence in doubt
| Reuters
SYDNEY, March 26 | Sun Mar 25, 2012 11:24pm EDT SYDNEY, March 26 (Reuters) - Olympic triathlon champion Emma Snowsill's hopes of defending her title in London suffered a blow at the weekend when she missed an event through illness and one of her fellow Australians won it. The 30-year-old Snowsill had been scheduled to race for the first time this season at the World Cup race at Mooloolaba in Queensland but a stomach complaint forced her to withdraw. Compatriot Erin Densham, who finished 22nd in Beijing four years ago, subsequently won the event by almost a minute in two hours, three minutes and 32 seconds to put herself in the frame for one of Australia's three berths for the London Games. Beijing bronze medallist and twice world champion Emma Moffatt has already been pre-selected for one of the spots while 20-year-old Emma Jackson put in a strong case for taking another with her win at the Oceania championships earlier this month. Three-times world champion Snowsill is the most successful women in the short history of the sport but is now likely to have to impress during the Sydney leg of the elite World Series on April 14 to make her case for selection. Densham, who underwent surgery on a heart defect three years ago, said she had not been thinking about a London berth and was just happy to showcase her talent. "I wasn't giving them a message, I was just running my race and doing what I normally do, what I know I can do," she said in a news release. "Whether that impresses them or not I don't know, but it's in their frame of mind now, I just did what I had to do." The women's triathlon at the London Olympics will take place in Hyde Park on Aug. 4.

FOREX-Yen broadly weaker as importers sell after rise
| Reuters
Sun Mar 25, 2012 11:22pm EDT * Euro seen facing tough resistance around $1.3300 * Bond sales, German data key events this week * Yen falls 0.5% against the dollar on importer selling By Antoni Slodkowski TOKYO, March 26 (Reuters) - The dollar bounced off a 10-day low against the yen on Monday, scooped up on the dip by Japan importers after it found support on the charts, although doubts lingered about the greenback's strength after a rally in the U.S. bond yields took a breather. The dollar muscled in on the Japanese currency, pushing it lower against other units such as the euro and the Australian dollar, while commodity currencies were broadly steady after a hammering last week on worries of slowing demand for resources. "Even though the dollar rally on the yen has lost a bit of momentum, the dollar is still strong after it didn't break below 81.97 support twice in the last two weeks," said Teppei Ino, currency strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in Tokyo. "I wouldn't expect Japanese repatriation flows to keep a lid on the dollar ahead of the fiscal year-end. We hear a lot about importers buying the dollar on the dip than offers by exporters," he said. Ino added many exporters have already finished their currency hedging, not only for the current business year to March 31, but also until the end of the first quarter of the next financial term. The dollar climbed 0.5 percent to 82.72 yen, inching closer to an 11-month high of 84.19 set on March 15. A strong support is seen at the 38.2 percent retracement of its Feb-March rise at 81.06. The yen also fell against the euro, shedding 0.7 percent to 109.74 and versus the Australian dollar, losing 0.2 percent to 86.50. Weak data from China and Europe last week reminded investors of the fragile nature of the economic recovery, stopping the selloff in safe-haven U.S. Treasuries and weighing on the greenback as short-term U.S. bond yields leveled out. That saw the dollar index, a gauge of its performance against a basket of major currencies, sink to a two-week low last week, before it recovered a little bit of ground on Monday to 79.37.  FACING A BARRAGE The euro hovered a whisker away from a three-week high against the dollar, last fetching $1.3267, close to Friday's peak of $1.3294. Last week it failed to breach resistance at $1.3302, a level representing a 61.8 percent retracement of its late February to mid-March fall. Investors shied away from chasing the last week's rally as the single currency faces a barrage of events this week, including key economic data from Germany, bond auctions in Italy and a meeting of euro zone finance ministers. Italy is looking to raise up to 7.5 billion euros in debt markets amid renewed pressure on peripheral euro zone debt sparked by fears of fiscal slippage. "Any sign of erosion in restored confidence for these bonds is likely to weigh on the euro," Barclays Capital analysts wrote in a client note. "We continue to expect EUR/USD to fall gradually to $1.20 in 12 months on the back of easier monetary conditions in the euro area and as the risk-premium will likely remain elevated." The Australian dollar, which suffered a steep fall last week, at one point popped up to $1.0493, from $1.0475 late in New York on Friday, with traders noting good buying interest from a Swiss bank. It was last flat at $1.0453. "In the short-term, and given the latest AUD skid was driven by slightly selective reading of comments from a BHP mining executive and contracting China manufacturing activity, we think over-extended (long) market positioning has exaggerated the decline in the AUD," said Gavin Friend, National Australia Bank market strategist. "For the coming week we look for a 1.0220-1.0550 range." Germany is to release Ifo business sentiment data later in the day, while the Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke could steal the limelight with a speech at 1200GMT as some are still looking for signs of further quantitative easing.

TEXT-S&P says Taiwan's non-life insurers improve price discipline
| Reuters
Sun Mar 25, 2012 11:16pm EDT (The following was released by the rating agency) TAIPEI (Standard & Poor's) March 26, 2012--An improvement in pricing discipline should help Taiwan's non-life insurers maintain stable underwriting performances in 2012. Local insurers benefited from a relatively mild year for catastrophe events in 2011. But the unpredictability of catastrophe claims emphasizes the importance of maintaining good capital buffers and enterprise risk management to protect credit profiles in the year ahead. That's according to an article titled "Taiwan Non-Life Insurance Sector Outlook: Pricing Discipline Should Support 2012 Underwriting Performance," that was published by Taiwan Ratings Corp. today on Standard & Poor's Ratings Services' Global Credit Portal. Taiwan Ratings is the Taipei-based subsidiary of Standard & Poor's. "A moderate economic growth forecast for Taiwan and greater pricing discipline among insurers underpin a stable outlook for the island's non-life sector in 2012, in our view," said credit analyst Eva Chou. "Price competition could gradually ease over the next few quarters as insurers begin selective re-pricing, particularly on products with higher loss experience. This would greatly support the non-life sector's stable underwriting performance in 2012." According to the report, the island's non-life insurers had relatively low catastrophe claims compared with their regional peers' in 2011, which helped prevent a downturn in the sector's earnings. But price competition has increased significantly since 2009 following a new round of price deregulation, which has dragged down the sector's underwriting performance from previous highs. "The introduction of reference rates for catastrophe insurance on commercial fire business since July 1, 2011, is likely to improve the sector's underwriting performance," said Ms. Chou. "But the full impact of higher pricing on this key product line will be uncertain until mid-2012." The report also says that a moderate economic growth outlook for Taiwan could also aid premium growth, despite the likelihood that the economy will grow at a slower pace in 2012.

Sinopec Q4 net profit falls 30 percent, misses estimates
| Reuters
By Wan Xu and Charlie Zhu HONG KONG/BEIJING | Sun Mar 25, 2012 11:07pm EDT HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - China Petroleum and Chemical Corp (Sinopec Corp) (0386.HK), the country's second largest integrated oil company, posted a 30 percent fall in fourth-quarter net profit, missing forecasts, as big losses at its refining arm offset upstream gains. Sinopec (600028.SS) (SNP.N), Asia's largest refiner, saw heavy refining losses last year as increases in domestic prices for oil products failed to keep pace with strong rises in international crude prices, and analysts said its earnings would still largely hinge on international oil prices. "Sinopec is facing a lot of uncertainties this year. Its refining segment is still losing money due to high crude prices. Its petrochemical business is also deteriorating due to rising cost and weaker demand," Yan Shi, analyst at UOB Kay Hian, said on Monday. Sinopec's profitability may have improved slightly after the government hiked domestic gasoline and diesel retail ceiling prices by 6-7 percent from March 20, and raised the threshold of windfall tax on crude oil production from $40 per barrel to $55 per barrel. However, with crude oil prices being pushed up by ongoing tensions between Iran and the West over its disputed nuclear program, Sinopec estimated in its annual report on Sunday that crude oil "will generally fluctuate in a high range". Sinopec's Hong Kong-listed shares were little changed in early trade on Monday, but are still up about 6 percent this year. They gained 9.8 percent in 2011, outperforming domestic peers PetroChina (0857.HK) and CNOOC (0883.HK), which lost 4.8 percent and 26 percent, respectively, in the same period. PetroChina and CNOOC are due to report their 2011 results later this week. China's fuel price hikes often come smaller and later than required under its pricing formula due to inflation concerns, leaving refiners saddled with mounting losses. Chinese oil firms make a profit on oil and gas production, fuel sales and chemical businesses but their refineries bear the brunt of losses caused by government price controls. Sinopec's refining losses amounted to 37.6 billion yuan ($5.9 billion) in 2011 versus an operating profit of 14.9 billion yuan in 2010. Its upstream exploration and production division realized an operating profit of 71.2 billion yuan last year, up from 46.7 billion yuan in 2010, thanks to stronger crude oil prices. Its oil and gas output edged up 1.6 percent year on year to 407.91 million barrels of oil equivalents (BOEs) in 2011, with crude production falling 1.9 percent and natural gas output rising 17.1 percent. For 2012, it plans to produce 326.52 million metric tonnes (359.93 million tons) of crude oil and 582.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas. The company processed 217 million metric tonnes of crude oil last year, up 3 percent year on year. Sinopec said it aims to process 225 million metric tonnes of crude this year. ASSET INJECTION Unlike PetroChina (601857.SS) (PTR.N) and CNOOC (CEO.N), which derive most of or all of their revenue from exploration and production, Sinopec is heavily focused on the downstream refining segment. Sinopec is expected to receive a gradual injection of overseas producing assets from its parent Sinopec Group, and the move should benefit Sinopec Corp shareholders in the long run, analysts say. Sinopec Corp's proven oil and gas reserve stood at 3.966 billion barrels of oil equivalents at the end of 2011, little changed from a year earlier, highlighting the need for its parent to inject assets into the listed company, analysts said. "The restructuring of Sinopec Corp via upstream asset injection from its parent company, Sinopec Group, is likely to see a gradual improvement in returns and potentially significant value upside in the long term," Barclays Capital analysts Scott Darling and Clement Chen said in an overnight research note. However, UOB Kay Hian's Yan Shi noted that most of the overseas exploration and production assets of Sinopec Group were still in early development and not yet profitable, and she did not see any near-term asset injection. Sinopec Corp bought deepwater oil assets in Angola in 2010 for $2.46 billion from its parent, marking its first acquisition of overseas upstream assets. Sinopec Group has launched at least 74 acquisition deals worth $48.1 billion since 2005, putting it ahead of all oil and gas majors over that period, Thomson Reuters data show. Sinopec Corp said its capital expenditure would hit 172.9 billion yuan this year, including 78.2 billion yuan earmarked for exploration and production. Its 2011 capex totaled 130.18 billion yuan. Its earnings totaled 10.3 billion yuan ($1.63 billion) in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with a forecast of 15.21 billion yuan, according to a Reuters calculation. The company's full-year net profit rose 1.4 percent to 71.7 billion yuan from 70.7 billion yuan in 2010. That lagged a consensus forecast of 76.6 billion yuan from 32 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It proposed a final dividend of 0.20 yuan per share.

Honda resumes Thai car output after 6-month hiatus
| Reuters
TOKYO, March 26 | Sun Mar 25, 2012 11:06pm EDT TOKYO, March 26 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co said it had resumed car production in Thailand on Monday after a near six-month suspension since unprecedented floods inundated its factory in Ayutthaya in early October. The restart is in line with plans projected in late January, when Japan's No.3 automaker said production in Thailand would be running at full speed from April, when other affected Asian production would also return to normal. Honda had said then that disruptions from the Thai floods would cost it production of 260,000 vehicles globally in the business year ending this month. Honda was hit the worst by the disaster, with the only car factory to be flooded. Rivals such as Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co normalised production by the end of 2011 as they found alternative sources for parts outside the disrupted supply chain.
