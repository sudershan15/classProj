Text:Food writer reveals unusual side of Italian desserts
| Reuters
By Richard Leong NEW YORK, March 6 | Mon Mar 5, 2012 11:59pm EST NEW YORK, March 6 (Reuters) - Italian delicacies like tiramisu and cannolis are familiar to people around the globe and the list may grow as veteran food writer Francine Segan shares unusual Italian desserts in her newest book. "Dolci: Italy's Sweets," is the result of her extensive research looking for recipes. Segan met Italian home cooks and professional chefs who make usual pairings like sugar, honey and chocolate with pasta, chickpeas, eggplant and even meat. The New York native spoke to Reuters about the wide range of Italian desserts, her motivation for doing the book and the surprises she encountered. Q: Why did you decide to focus on desserts with this book? A: "I felt I traveled a lot through Italy. While my first loves are pizzas, pasta and prosciutto, I realized that there are so many desserts we don't know about here in the States. I was shocked. As I travel more and more, I realize not only don't we know about them in the states. But from one region (in Italy) to the next, they don't even know them." Q: How do you think that happened? A: "Italy was so divided. It was more like 20 different countries. Now it's definitely like 10 major regions. They are really competitive with each other. It became a treasure hunt for me to discover authentic recipes, not just from a restaurant, but a restaurant that's been around and is really entrenched ... Then I was fascinated by some of the bizarre ones." Q: What is the biggest shock you discover during your research for the book? A: "The biggest surprise is that they eat pasta for dessert. That was a shock. I thought it was a joke. I thought it was just one place. And then I was doing an article on chocolate in Piedmont. That's where I learned about it two years ago ... More and more people started looking at me like 'You don't know we have pasta for dessert?' There are dessert raviolis. Then I was shocked by how many recipes there were in the different regions. Some of these recipes you could find them in books going back to the 1700s. They are not new at all." Q: Did you manage to convince anyone here to taste those unusual desserts? A: "There is this mini meat-and-chocolate turnover pie from Sicily. When I tell people that it has meat and chocolate, people don't want to taste it. I have to lie to them. I have to say there is a surprise in there and ask whether you are vegetarian." Q; This book is a collection of other people's recipes, not original ones you created for your other books? Why? A: "I personally feel I want to preserve the integrity of regional food. Sometimes I feel there is almost a little too much tweaking going on. I personally don't love going to an Italian restaurant here in the States and find dishes you have never even seen in Italy, that would appall Italians, the combination of flavors. "There is too much sauce. I feel like they really do a good job over there. Most of all, I feel like I want to give you a little travel trip about what is real in Italy, so I wanted them to be 100 percent authentic. "When I wanted panna cotta, I went to the region where it was created. I went to a cooking school where the person is known to make the best panna cotta. I went to establishments which have been around for dozens and dozens of years. There are recipes handwritten in books going back to the 1800s and made the same way. There are also bloggers who are doing what I am hoping to do, which is to preserve some of the classic recipes before we nouveau cuisine, gastro, micro ourselves crazy." Q: What is a common mistake of making Italian desserts? A: "People put too much butter and sugar (in the dessert). You don't drown butter and sugar in Italian desserts. You don't want too many ingredients." Q: Since writing this book, what Italian desserts you make at home for yourself? A: "The thing I want to go back to a lot because they are so amazingly flexible ... are these little peach-shaped cookies (pesche dolci). They could sit inside a sealed bag for months. You could fill them with lemon curd, Nutella or pastry cream. There are also the pasta crisps. You use leftover pasta, twirl it with fork and fry it in olive oil and drizzle them with honey and pistachio nuts. It sounds so simple but it really holds together. It's not greasy. It's crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside." Hazelnut Chocolate Pasta (Pasta al Gianduiotti) Serves 4 1/2 pound angel hair or other thin long pasta 12 gianduiotti, hazelnut chocolate candies, or 12 tablespoons quality hazelnut chocolate spread Whipped cream or mascarpone cheese Chopped hazelnuts Hazelnut liqueur such as Frangelico (optional) Cook the pasta according to package directions. Drain. Put 1 gianduiotti in each of 4 wine glasses or dessert bowls. Divide the hot pasta among them and top each with 2 more gianduiotti. Serve immediately, topped with a dollop of whipped cream or mascarpone cheese, a splash of hazelnut liqueur and sprinkle of hazelnuts, if you like.

Bruins bring in Turco as replacement for injured Rask
| Reuters
Mon Mar 5, 2012 11:58pm EST (Reuters) - The Boston Bruins moved quickly to shore up their goaltending depth on Monday after backup Tuukka Rask was diagnosed with strains to his lower abdomen and groin that will sideline him for 4-6 weeks. The defending Stanley Cup champions addressed their loss immediately by signing veteran Canadian goaltender Marty Turco to a one-year deal, the Bruins announced on their team website (bruins.nhl.com). The 36-year-old Turco, who played for Chicago last season before competing in limited action in Austria this year, must clear waivers before joining the club. Rask left Saturday's loss to the New York Islanders as he was hurt while making a save. The Finn has served as a capable deputy to starter Tim Thomas and compiled a 11-8-3 record this season with a 2.05 goals against average. Turco has played in 47 post-season games and will bring added experience to the Northeast-leading Bruins (38-23-3), who are making a strong bid to repeat as champions.

China's Proview says in talks with creditor seeking bankruptcy
| Reuters
March 6 | Mon Mar 5, 2012 11:57pm EST March 6 (Reuters) - Proview Technology (Shenzhen), embroiled in a legal battle with Apple Inc over the iPad trademark, is in talks with a Taiwan creditor that is seeking its bankruptcy, Proview's chairman and lawyer said on Tuesday. Taiwan's Fubon Insurance, one several Proview creditors and a unit of Fubon Financial Holding Co Ltd, has applied to the courts for bankruptcy proceedings against Proview because of $8.68 million in outstanding debt, lawyers and media reports said. If the courts accept the bankruptcy application, it could disrupt Proview's high-profile lawsuit with Apple being heard at the Guangzhou high court, which has yet to make a decision on whether Apple has infringed upon Proview's claim to the iPad trademark, lawyers and analysts said. "We are in talks with Fubon now. We will want to protect our creditors," Proview Technology Chairman Yang Long-san told Reuters. Proview's lawyer from Grandall Legal Group, Roger Xie, said other creditors had not made similar applications. "The rest of the creditors understand the situation and they know Proview still has some assets, such as the iPad trademark, which could be used to pay back its loans," he said. Proview's main creditors are Bank of China Ltd , China Minsheng Banking Corp Ltd , China Development Bank, China Guangfa Bank, Bank of Communications Co Ltd, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Co Ltd, Hua Xia Bank Co Ltd and Shenzhen Pingan Bank. The legal tussle between Apple, the world's most valuable company, and Proview, whose Hong Kong-listed parent Proview International Holdings Ltd is near bankrupt, has escalated in recent months, with the iPad 3 due to launch this week. Last week, the Higher People's Court of Guangzhou heard an appeal by the U.S. company on the iPad lawsuit, although lawyers said a decision would not be reached for weeks or months.

INSIGHT-Papua New Guinea mountain disaster asks questions of Exxon
| Reuters
Mon Mar 5, 2012 11:57pm EST * Landslide swept over quarry used for Exxon gas project * Independent expert had raised safety concerns * Call for thorough, independent inquiry * Concerns over unrest among local landowners By Rebekah Kebede March 6 (Reuters) - A deadly landslide in the mountains of Papua New Guinea, near where U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil is building a $15.7 billion gas project, is raising fresh questions about the global energy industry's scramble for ever harder-to-reach resources. The landslide tore through a quarry used by Exxon in January, killing at least 25 people in the poor South Pacific country, but it has stirred little international publicity, even though an expert report had questioned the safety of the excavations. The controversy also raises some familiar issues aired by critics of "big oil" in previous disasters: a pressure to deliver results, contractors found to have cut corners and remote operations that limit government oversight. Exxon, which was using the quarry to produce rock and gravel needed to develop the upstream end of its gas-export project, has said it is unclear what caused the disaster in Papua New Guinea's steep, heavily wooded Southern Highlands. The Papua New Guinea government has denied the quarry contributed to the landslide, but local villagers, environmental activists and an international landslide expert are unconvinced and want a thorough, independent investigation -- something that shows no sign of happening despite evidence that quarrying work was being rushed to meet tight construction deadlines. Less than 12 months before the landslide, an independent consultant, Italian firm D'Appolonia, found Exxon's quarrying operations did not meet the environmental and social standards demanded by the company's creditors and it concluded that workers had been under pressure to meet deadlines. "The overall impression of (the consultant) is that incidents and situations have developed because the project has circumvented correct procedures in the interest of schedule...," D'Appolonia said in a report dated March last year and commissioned by the project's main creditors. "The project will need to make sure that schedule does not dominate decisions," it added. The report, compiled by a firm that also counts Italian energy group Eni and the European Commission among its clients, was sitting in a corner of Exxon's website when, just before dawn on Jan. 24, a mountainside collapsed above one of several quarries Exxon was running in and around the site.  A villager recalled hearing a loud crack ring out across the valley as the slope gave way, collapsing through the Tumbi quarry and burying homes that had been perched beneath it. The disaster left a trail of debris stretching more than 500 metres (500 yards) and also carved through a road into the project. All of the bodies of those killed remain buried in the debris, according to the provincial governor. "I have never seen this type of (landslide) before in my life in that area," the villager, Hipson Puma, 39, said by telephone. Exxon said it had closed the Tumbi quarry in August last year, five months before the landslide, because it no longer needed to use it and had taken heed of the D'Appolonia report, making the site secure. It also notes that landslides are common in that part of the Southern Highlands. "This was a significant landslide, and we, like many others, want to know how it occurred so we can understand the environment in which we'll be operating, given we'll be in this region for many years to come," spokeswoman Rebecca Arnold said, when asked if Exxon would support an independent inquiry. Exxon operates the project and owns 33.2 percent of it. Australian companies Oil Search and Santos also hold significant stakes, with 29 percent and 13.5 percent respectively, while the state-run National Petroleum Company of Papua New Guinea owns 16.8 percent. Japan's Nippon Oil Exploration has 4.7 percent and local landowner group Mineral Resources Development Company 2.8 percent. D'Appolonia also said, in a later report, that conditions at the Tumbi quarry had improved by August. But some locals say Exxon had expanded the quarry too rapidly -- a charge it denies -- and they are using the March report to support their claim that the oil company was to blame. The Exxon spokeswoman said she did not have information on how much the quarry had been expanded. The company had planned to relocate 14 households to make way for the works at the site, which had been used for smaller excavations for many years before it reopened for the project in 2010. A map of the original plans for the site show it intended to double its size in terms of area over 24 months. It used the quarry for 15 months.  NO SIGN OF INDEPENDENT INQUIRY David Petley, director of Durham University's International Landslide Centre, in Britain, said poorly managed quarries and mines often contributed to large landslides and that a thorough investigation could help prevent future disasters. "My working hypothesis, which needs to be tested, is that the quarry played a role in increasing the susceptibility of the slope to failure. Rainfall was then the trigger for the final collapse," said Petley, a geography professor who has offered to help with any investigation. "The fact that problems with (the quarry's) operation had been identified by independent consultants strengthens that possibility, but it remains far from certain without a proper investigation," Petley added. The Papua New Guinea government, a part-owner of the development, the nation's largest ever, has given no indication that it will conduct an independent inquiry into the disaster. The Papua New Guinea National Disaster Centre conducted what it calls an "initial report", concluding that the trigger for the landslide was heavy rainfall. It does not mention whether or not the quarry had been ruled out or had even been considered as a contributing factor to the landslide. The centre, which is responsible for recommending a more detailed investigation, says a landslide of that magnitude had not occurred in Papua New Guinea since 1998. But the centre's chief, Martin Mose, said there were no plans for an inquiry. He gave no clear reason. "There is still not discussion of a detailed investigation," Mose said last month by phone from Port Moresby, the capital. "We haven't sanctioned anything yet. An investigation of that magnitude can be taken later on," he said, without giving a timeframe. He added that it was up to the government, not independent experts, to carry out any full investigation.  TOO MUCH OF A HURRY? The upstream gas field is being carved out of remote highlands, where communities live in thatched huts and tend small, terraced farms. It will feed gas by pipe to a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, which is scheduled to start up in 2014 and is estimated to boost the national economy by a quarter. Endowed with resources, Papua New Guinea hopes the project will revive its patchy investment reputation: its Bougainville copper mine, one of the world's largest, has been dormant for more than 20 years because of local unrest, and in the past 10 years foreign investors have pulled out of its Ok Tedi copper mine after years of environmental complaints. Some villagers, a local landowner and community groups reached by phone say they suspect both Exxon and the government are in too much of a hurry to bring the project onstream. Even after the disaster, some complained that the recovery effort gave too much priority to re-opening the project's access road. "We are talking about a quarry mountain collapsing," said Joseph Warai, the director of Community Based Health Services, who has been working in the area for years and believes it is "obvious" the landslide was caused by the excavations. "Our government is also an investor, so who really represents the people in especially this type of disaster...?" Warai said. "You're looking at the state being a player and we seem to have no neutral regulator." A call to the office of the Papua New Guinea works minister, who is responsible for disaster recovery, was not returned. Exxon denied it had ever put timetables ahead of safety. "(Exxon's local unit) Esso Highlands absolutely considers safety and responsible operations more important than schedule commitments, and our actions have been consistent with those priorities," Arnold, the firm's spokeswoman, said in an email. In noting some of the shortcomings of the quarrying operation, the D'Appolonia report also ruled out any suggestion that Exxon or its quarry contractors, Clough Curtain Brothers Joint Venture and McConnell Dowell Consolidated Contractors joint venture, had deliberately compromised safety. It found workers on the ground were dedicated and gave a positive impression, despite citing several earlier mishaps across the project, including a mudslide in which no one was hurt. But, overall, the consultant highlighted the pressure on workers to meet schedules -- a pressure that industry analysts say is only increasing as Exxon nears the 2014 target date for starting LNG deliveries. Before the landslide, some analysts had already expected the project could slip back until 2015. "Any delay, no matter what the reason ... means more money. Anytime a project's delayed, it's going to increase the capital expenditure for the project. That would affect the economics of the project," said Natalie Bravo, an analyst with PFC Energy. A delay in PNG LNG would also force Exxon to scramble to find enough gas to supply its customers, who have already signed long-term contracts with the company starting in 2014.  OTHER CONCERNS The project is one of the most complex LNG developments ever built, experts say. It will pipe gas over hundreds of km (miles) of mountainous terrain to the LNG plant near Port Moresby, with the project partners building new roads as they go. "The challenges were huge. I wouldn't be surprised if there were cost and time overruns," said Tony Regan, an LNG analyst with Tri Zen International in Singapore. The Exxon project runs several quarries in and around its Southern Highlands gas field, and the Tumbi operation was not the only one that drew criticism from D'Appolonia. The consultant also raised concerns about safety at the neighboring Tameya quarry, about half a kilometre away but not damaged by the landslide. The Tameya quarry was flagged as unsafe in March 2011, and deemed a possible threat to human life. By August, D'Appolonia had determined that the "conditions" at Tameya had not changed, though a project creditor, ANZ bank , says that an unpublished report from a November site visit has since given it a clean bill of health. D'Appolonia's lead consultant declined to comment on the reports. It was hired by lenders to ensure the project met the environmental and social requirement of the loan agreements.  SIMMERING DISCONTENT Impartial public oversight of operations in such a remote region can be difficult. Local tribal chiefs are likely to have more power than the federal government, and basic logistics such as transport and accommodation can be difficult. During the National Disaster Centre's initial report into the disaster, Exxon provided logistics, transport and accommodation for the government team. With no full independent investigation on the horizon, there are concerns that landowners could seek out their own justice. The project has been plagued from its inception by disgruntled landowners who feel they are not being dealt their fair share of the windfalls from the project. Early work was delayed in 2009 due to landowner concerns. Anderson Agiru, the Southern Highlands provincial governor, says he believes the landslide was a natural disaster but that an investigation is needed to clear the air. "We are talking about a large number of lives being lost here... it's very sensitive and it's in their interests to desensitise this problem because it has the potential to become explosive, especially in light of the huge investments in the PNG LNG (project) in the area," he said by telephone. "The pace at which the office of emergency and disaster, the government is moving in relation to this is too slow, far too slow. They need to act with some speed," Agiru said.

Mon Mar 5, 2012 11:47pm EST (The following was released by the rating agency) SINGAPORE (Standard & Poor's) March 6, 2012--Standard & Poor's Ratings Services today assigned its 'BB-' foreign currency issue rating to the proposed issue of U.S. dollar notes by Development Bank of Mongolia (DBM). The bank's inaugural issue is a senior unsecured drawdown from its US$600 million euro medium term note program, which we rated 'BB-'. The tenure of the proposed issue is expected to be between three and five years. DBM is wholly owned by the government and is the only policy bank in Mongolia. The bank's mandate is to secure financing for a variety of projects that constitute key components of the government's development strategy. These include railroad and road transportation, infrastructure for housing projects, energy, and industrial development. All payments related to the notes under the program have the unconditional, irrevocable, and timely guarantee of the government of Mongolia (BB-/Positive/B). The obligations rank pari passu with other external debt obligations of the sovereign. We have equalized the issue rating with the sovereign credit rating on Mongolia because of the strength of the sovereign guarantee and ownership, and the bank's policy role. The sovereign ratings on Mongolia reflect the country's underdeveloped, resource-based economic profile and weak policy environment. Mongolia's exceptionally strong growth outlook over the medium term, and moderating public and external debt ratios balance these weaknesses. Continued strong donor and multilateral support also underpin the rating by ensuring a moderate debt-servicing burden.
