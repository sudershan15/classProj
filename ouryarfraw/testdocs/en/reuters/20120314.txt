Text:US-Korea free trade pact takes effect amid controversy
| Reuters
Wed Mar 14, 2012 11:59pm EDT * Pact slashes tariffs on U.S. manufactured, farm goods * Deal stalled for years by U.S. concern about auto trade * Implementation could hang on outcome of Korean elections By Doug Palmer WASHINGTON, March 15 (Reuters) - A U.S.-South Korea free trade pact that has stirred controversy in both countries since it was negotiated took effect on Thursday with opposition politicians in Seoul vowing to block parts of the deal they don't like. "The U.S.-Korea agreement is a landmark deal with an important ally," U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said in a statement hailing the accord as the most significant U.S. free trade pact in 20 years. "Starting today, Korea's doors are wide open for Made-In-America exports that will support well-paying jobs here at home," Kirk said. U.S. President Barack Obama and South Korean President Lee Myung-bak spoke by phone on Tuesday "to welcome the entry into force of the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS) at midnight on March 15 in both countries," the White House said in a statement. The pact, which was signed in 2007 and finally approved by both countries in late 2011, immediately eliminates 80 percent of South Korea's duties on U.S. manufactured goods and nearly two-thirds of its duties on U.S. farm products. South Korea is the United States' seventh-largest trading partner and has an economy valued at $1 trillion dollars. The pact's tariff cuts are expected to boost U.S. exports to Korea by $10 billion to $11 billion, helping to support 70,000 jobs. The agreement mostly negotiated by the administration of former U.S. President George W. Bush and former South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun also opens up more of South Korea's large services market to U.S. companies and has new protections for exporters, investors, and intellectual property rights holders. Lee's decision shortly after taking office in 2008 to reopen South Korea's market to U.S. beef triggered massive protests that caused the new president's popularity to plummet. Within the United States, opposition from Obama's fellow Democrats prompted Obama to renegotiate the deal in late 2010 to get a better deal for U.S. automakers. Ford Motor Co. and union groups complained the original pact failed to tear down longstanding "non-tariff" barriers to South Korea's auto market. Once finally submitted to Congress, the pact sailed swiftly through both the House of Representatives and Senate. Lee's party rammed the agreement through the South Korean parliament in November, despite an attempt by an opposition lawmaker to disrupt the vote by detonating a tear gas cannister. In February, nearly 100 South Korean parliamentarians, mostly from the opposition party, wrote to President Barack Obama to urge him not to implement the agreement without making a number of changes first, particularly in the section governing bilateral investment disputes. "If our cordial and earnest request would be overlooked by your administration, we would have to take all measures possible to freeze implementation of the KORUS FTA, as we are expected to gain a majority of seats in the National Assembly in the coming (April 11) general elections," the lawmakers said. Expecting their candidate also to win the South Korean presidential election in December, the lawmakers warned "the agreement would be subject to termination" if not revised by then. Jeffrey Schott, an senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said he doubts the Korean opposition party will carry through on its threats. Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch has accused Obama of rushing implementation of the pact to "cement" it into place before South Korea's opposition party takes power.

CORRECTING and REPLACING -- China Nuokang Bio-Pharmaceutical Inc. Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Financial Results
| Reuters
Wed Mar 14, 2012 11:59pm EDT  BEIJING, March 14, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Following a release published earlier today by China Nuokang Bio-Pharmaceutical Inc. (Nasdaq:NKBP), please note that subheading for the non-GAAP adjusted net loss for the fourth quarter of 2011 has been updated for a typo and the accompanying financial tables have been updated for minor errors. The corrected release follows: 4Q11 Revenue was RMB57.0 Million ($9.1 Million) 4Q11 Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Loss was RMB6.3 Million ($1.0 million) FY11 Revenue was RMB288.3 Million ($45.8 Million) FY11 Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income was RMB34.6 Million ($5.5 million) Live conference call to be held Thursday, March 15, 2012 at 8:00 am ET China Nuokang Bio-Pharmaceutical Inc. (Nasdaq:NKBP) ("Nuokang" or the "Company"), a leading China-based biopharmaceutical company focused on the research, development, manufacture, marketing and sales of hospital-based medical products, today announced unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2011. Mr. Baizhong Xue, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We believe this quarter marked an important milestone in Nuokang's restructuring efforts. As we have noted in the past few months, including in our announcement of the recent changes in our management team, it became clear toward the end of 2011 that Nuokang needed to refocus our direction in order to achieve greater success as a publicly-listed and diversified pharmaceutical company. We are proud of the staff that helped Nuokang build Baquting into a market leader and successfully become a U.S.-listed company. At the same time, we believe that the changes in our management team will allow us to better lead Nuokang in the future. Financially, we have taken the steps to create a healthier balance sheet. We have paid down most of our debt, increased operating cash flow by decreasing days sales outstanding, removed the overhang of our lease obligations and expensed one-time costs to show a cleaner balance sheet. We believe these steps are necessary to prepare Nuokang to achieve its long-term potential. "Our financial performance this quarter was affected by the aforementioned efforts. First, as we have noted before, we recognize that our exploration of certain strategic alternatives to increase shareholder value has negatively impacted our short-term results. While our externally managed marketing agent sales continued to grow and the volume of Baquting sales for the fourth quarter remained relatively stable, this performance was tempered by the decrease in our higher-margin and higher-price direct sales. This shift in revenue mix therefore resulted in a lower average price per unit and a noticeable sequential revenue decline. Second, we resolved our obligation through a recent contract for the Penglai plant for RMB13.4 million. We believe this action was prudent as it removes the financial overhang of the potential costs. Lastly, to present a cleaner balance sheet, we have conservatively incurred an allowance for non-trade receivables of RMB8.6 million. These efforts to strengthen our financial condition and the one-time and non-operational charge of RMB11.6 million related to exploration of strategic alternatives, led to a net loss for the fourth quarter of 2011. Moving forward, we are excited to have a stronger management team and healthier balance sheet to better support our future growth. "Overall, we believe that our efforts have laid a solid foundation for a gradual but steady recovery from 2011. Despite the challenges of the fourth quarter, we are pleased to note that Baquting remains the leader in the hemocoagulase market with 36% market share. Looking forward, we are focused on maintaining this market leadership position while further strengthening management of our direct sales team to achieve a more favorable revenue mix and greater sales volume. Our new vice president of sales and marketing has proactively reached out to employees to cultivate greater confidence in and excitement for Nuokang's growth potential. In addition to Baquting, revenue from Kaitong has been steadily growing. For 2012, we expect to see revenue contribution from Kaitong and our newly acquired Alpha Lipoic Acid Capsule. We also expect our expenses to normalize in 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, during which we chose to conservatively recognize one-time, non-operational charges. Although the recovery process may be gradual, we are confident that 2012 will show sequential revenue and profitability growth compared to 2011." Fourth Quarter 2011 Financial Highlights Fourth Quarter 2011 Financial Performance Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2011 was RMB57.0 million ($9.1 million), compared to RMB79.3 million in the prior year period. Revenue from Baquting decreased to RMB52.2 million ($8.3 million) from RMB76.7 million in the prior year period, primarily attributable to a decline in the performance of the Company's direct sales channel. Baquting revenue as a percentage of total revenue was 91.6%, compared to 96.7% in the prior year period. Revenue from other products increased to RMB4.8 million ($0.8 million) from RMB2.6 million in the prior year period, driven by gradually increasing revenue contribution from Kaitong. Gross profit was RMB47.2 million ($7.5 million), compared to RMB70.0 million in the prior year period. Gross margin was 82.7%, compared to 88.2% in the prior year period. This margin decline was due to a shift in revenue mix towards a greater proportion of lower-margin marketing agent sales. Operating loss was RMB36.8 million ($5.9 million), compared to an operating income of RMB4.2 million in the prior year period. This is a reflection of the incurrence of one-time charges in the fourth quarter of 2011, including costs associated with the Company's exploration of certain strategic alternatives of RMB11.6 million ($1.8 million) and an increase in allowance for non-trade receivables of RMB8.6 million ($1.4 million). Research and development expenses were RMB3.6 million ($0.6 million), compared to RMB4.2 million in the prior year period. Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.4%, compared to 5.2% in the prior year period, primarily due to the lower revenue base for the fourth quarter of 2011. Selling, marketing and distribution expenses decreased 7.0% to RMB44.8 million ($7.1 million) from RMB48.2 million in the prior year period due to lower revenues, partially offset by the Company's continued investment in market development of its new-to-market products. General and administrative expenses was RMB35.5 million ($5.6 million), compared to RMB13.4 million in the prior year period, primarily as a result of significant one-time charges, such as costs associated with the Company's exploration of strategic alternatives and an increase in allowance for non-trade receivables. As these are non-recurring expenses, the Company expects general and administrative expenses to normalize in the coming quarters. The Company recognized a tax benefit of RMB3.8 million ($0.6 million), compared to a tax expense of RMB1.5 million in the prior year period. The tax benefit is due to the loss it incurred in the fourth quarter of 2011. Net loss was RMB46.7 million ($7.4 million), or RMB2.42 ($0.39) per diluted ADS, compared to a net income of RMB278,000, or RMB0.01 per diluted ADS, in the prior year period. Non-GAAP adjusted net loss, excluding share-based compensation, foreign exchange gains and losses and other one-time, non-operational charges, was RMB6.3 million ($1.0 million), compared to a net income of RMB3.9 million in the prior year period. For the quarter ended December 31, 2011, the Company had approximately 154.2 million weighted average diluted ordinary shares outstanding, or 19.3 million weighted average diluted ADSs. Full Year Ended December 31, 2011 Financial Performance For the full year ended December 31, 2011, revenue was RMB288.3 million ($45.8 million), compared to RMB315.8 million for the full year ended December 31, 2010. Gross profit was RMB249.8 million ($39.7 million), compared to RMB278.5 million in the prior year. Operating income was RMB18.7 million ($3.0 million), compared to RMB65.9 million in the prior year. Net loss was RMB14.0 million ($2.2 million), or RMB0.72 ($0.11) per diluted ADS, compared to a net income of RMB46.1 million, or RMB2.32 per diluted ADS, for the prior year. Non-GAAP adjusted net income was RMB34.6 million ($5.5 million), compared to RMB60.9 million in the prior year. For the full year ended December 31, 2011, the Company had approximately 155.9 million weighted average diluted ordinary shares outstanding, or 19.5 million weighted average diluted ADSs. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of RMB179.4 million ($28.5 million), compared to RMB191.8 million as of December 31, 2010. New Product Performance The Company continued to make progress on the commercialization of the following products: Kaitong: The Company continued to make progress on market education and sales channel development for Kaitong. As of March 2012, the Company has won tenders in eight provinces and four military zones and continues its nationwide marketing campaign in order to drive awareness and understanding of Kaitong. Looking forward, the Company expects Kaitong revenues to grow steadily but gradually throughout 2012 as it continues to bid for additional regions. Alpha Lipoic Acid Capsule ("ALA"): In January 2012, the Company expanded its product portfolio to the diabetic drug category by acquiring the manufacturing license and marketing rights for ALA, an antioxidant product that addresses diabetic neuropathy. The manufacturing license is being transferred to the Company's plant in Penglai from that of the seller. The Company has also already won tenders in four provinces and two military zones for ALA. In-licensed Products: The Company has submitted testing results for Dianatal® for the final stage of import license approval to the SFDA. For the cardiovascular product, the Company is also awaiting SFDA review of testing results for the final stage before receiving the import license. The Company expects SFDA approval by the end of 2012 for both products. Non-GAAP Measures Adjusted net income (loss) is presented to better illustrate the Company's ongoing and core operational results. Adjusted net income (loss) is defined as net income excluding share-based compensation expense, foreign exchange losses, other one-time charges, other loss and tax expenses. Adjusted net income (loss) may be calculated differently, and therefore Nuokang's adjusted net income (loss) may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted net income (loss) is not a measure of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities and other measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Items excluded from adjusted net income (loss) are significant and necessary components to the operations of the Company's business, and, therefore, adjusted net income (loss) should only be used as a supplemental measure of operating performance.

Knicks win big in coach Woodson's debut

New York Knicks forward Carmelo Anthony dribbles the ball as interim head coach Mike Woodson looks on in the first quarter of their NBA basketball game against the Portland Trail Blazers at Madison Square Garden in New York, March 14, 2012. Credit: Reuters/Adam Hunger By Larry Fine NEW YORK | Wed Mar 14, 2012 11:54pm EDT NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mike Woodson did not have long to wait for his first win as new coach of the New York Knicks as his team trampled the Portland Trail Blazers 121-79 at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday to end a six-game losing streak. Woodson is acting as interim head coach after Mike D'Antonio resigned earlier in the day. "For our team, this was an important game," said Woodson. "We're still trying to stay in the playoff hunt." The Knicks kept pace with Milwaukee after the Bucks beat Cleveland to remain tied with New York (19-24) for the eighth and final Eastern Conference playoff berth. Portland, losers of six of their last eight, dropped to 20-23. "It's kind of an emotional day, you lose your head coach, who I have a great deal of respect for," said Woodson, praising his players' effort at a difficult time. "They stepped up, they made plays on both ends of the floor. "The thing I was very impressed with was how they defended and how they shared the ball offensively," he added. The Knicks squeezed the Trail Blazers with some zealous defending, holding them to less than 40 percent shooting and forcing three 24-second violations. Playing with enthusiasm and energy, the Knicks raced to a 25-12 first quarter lead with Carmelo Anthony and Amar'e Stoudemire setting the tone by running the floor and feasting on fast breaks. The lead increased to 55-29 at intermission and by the fourth quarter, long-range shooters J.R. Smith and Steve Novak found their touch and finished as the game's top scorers with 23 and 20 points. In all, the Knicks made a sizzling 19-of-38 from beyond the arc. Anthony contributed seven assists to go with his 16 points, while Stoudemire shot 8-for-10, mostly on dunks, in scoring 17. "It was an unfortunate day," said Anthony, who had seemed to struggle under D'Antoni's offensive system. "We responded well." Jeremy Lin said he felt a debt of gratitude to D'Antoni for giving him a chance to escape the bench and become a surprise sensation at point guard. "Obviously, I miss him a lot," said Lin, who had six points, six assists and six turnovers in just under 23 minutes on the floor. "I am not going to forget what he did for me personally. I am sad to see him go. I owe him a lot. "We just played really hard," added Lin. "We came out with a chip on our shoulder and obviously wanted to get Coach Woodson his first win as our head coach." Woodson said he knew many players felt a bond with D'Antoni. "You look into their eyes when something like this has happened, you wonder as a coach are they mentally there," he said. "I just told them to take a deep breath and relax. Let's go out and have fun and play basketball the way I think we're capable of doing and I think they responded."

Salesforce HR tool combines social networking and employee reviews
| Reuters
By Sarah Mitroff at VentureBeat Wed Mar 14, 2012 11:47pm EDT Remember when your Facebook feed was dotted with achievements that your friends won by playing Farmville? Well, youll see something similar now with Salesforces new Rypple HR tool. Rypple uses badges and achievements to praise employees for the work theyre doing. It comes preloaded with cutesy badges, and managers can custom create any badge or achievement they like, such as Sales staff just closed a huge deal, lets buy private jets! Salesforce acquired Rypple in December 2011 and announced its version of the service today at Salesforces Cloudforce Social Enterprise Tour event in San Francisco. In the acquisition announcement, VentureBeat reported that Salesforce would re-brand Rypple Successforce. Guess that name didnt stick, because Salesforces branded version of the app is called, not-so-creatively, Salesforce Rypple. Performance reviews are the least enjoyable tasks done and they always have to be done once per year. We want to ensure there is a continual dialogue between employees and managers, Salesforce software development executive John Wookey said in an interview with VentureBeat, Rypple defines key results and actions, monitors the status of objectives and fosters a dialogue of the goals being set in the organizations, so people understand whats expected. Employees and managers can access the service from its own website, which features a social media-like stream of achievements and goals. Anyone can set goals and objectives, then invite people to participate, and track their progress. Once someone does something awesome, you give them a badge. Employees can also Thank fellow employees for helping each other out. Thanks to Salesforces acquisition of the company, Rypple is now accessible from the Salesforce dashboard. When you see that someone has closed a deal in Salesforce, you can give them a Rypple badge without leaving the site. Badges will also show up in your companys Chatter feed, so everyone can see what you did and give you praise. Salesforce Rypple will go up against Taleo and SuccessFactors, two human capital management companies that help companies measure their employees performance and offer feedback.

Court lets two CVS stores sell controlled drugs

Credit: Reuters/Mike Segar By Anna Yukhananov WASHINGTON | Wed Mar 14, 2012 11:46pm EDT WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A appeals court ruled that CVS Caremark Corp may continue selling potentially addictive prescription drugs at two Florida pharmacies, blocking a Drug Enforcement Administration order to suspend shipments. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued an order on Wednesday temporarily lifting a February 4 DEA suspension that was issued because of concerns that CVS was not adequately watching for prescription abuse. The DEA said the two CVS pharmacies in Sanford, about 30 miles south of Orlando, were inappropriately filling prescriptions for the painkiller oxycodone, which can be highly addictive. They also had suspicious sales of other controlled substances. CVS said the DEA had acted in an "arbitrary and capricious" manner in ordering sales suspended, and that remedial steps taken by CVS were sufficient. It said it would suffer irreparable harm if forced to stop filling prescriptions at the pharmacies. Initially a federal district court judge blocked the DEA order but on Tuesday agreed to let it take effect. CVS appealed the decision. The appeals court in Washington on Wednesday granted CVS's request and issued a stay pending further proceedings. The court ordered CVS to file a response by March 19 and the DEA to file its response by March 21, according to the court docket. The litigation stems from the DEA's battle against prescription drug abuse, which has surged in the United States to eclipse abuse of most illicit drugs including heroin and cocaine. The DEA said in court documents that about 7 million Americans abuse pharmaceuticals made with controlled substances for purposes not related to medicine and that Florida is the center of the growing epidemic. The CVS appeal comes on the heels of a similar stay order issued to Cardinal Health Inc after the DEA tried to prevent it from selling any controlled substances from its facility in Lakeland, Florida. The DEA said four of Cardinal's customers, including the two CVS stores, filled illegitimate prescriptions. The case is Holiday CVS LLC v. Justice Department et al in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, No. 12-5072.

TEXT:Fitch rates Bank of Ayudhya's THB20bn programme
| Reuters
Wed Mar 14, 2012 11:45pm EDT (The following was released by the rating agency) BANGKOK/SINGAPORE, March 14 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned Bank of Ayudhya Public Company Limited's (BAY; 'AA-(tha)'/Stable) unsubordinated unsecured debenture programme of up to THB20bn, with a maturity not exceeding 270 days, a National Short-term rating of 'F1+(tha)'. At the same time, the agency has affirmed the bank's ratings. A full rating breakdown is provided below. Proceeds raised from the programme will be used for the bank's general corporate purposes and liquidity management. BAY's unsubordinated unsecured debenture programme is rated at the same level as the bank's National Short-Term rating of 'F1+(tha)', which is consistent with its National Long-Term rating. The bank's ratings are based on the bank's standalone financial position, robust performance, strong capital position and continued improvement of asset quality. The ratings also consider BAY's greater use of wholesale funding, relative to similarly rated peers, to better match its asset profile. BAY was established in 1945 and is Thailand's fifth-largest commercial bank. It had a market share in loans and deposits of about 8% each as of end-2011. Its key subsidiaries are involved in auto finance, credit cards, consumer finance, securities and fund management. Given BAY's share of deposits and loans, there is a moderate probability of government support, should this be needed. Bank of Ayudhya Public Company Limited's ratings - Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR affirmed at 'BBB'; Outlook Stable - Short-Term Foreign Currency IDR affirmed at 'F3' - Viability Rating affirmed at 'bbb' - Support Rating affirmed at '3' - Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'BB+' - National Long-Term Rating affirmed at 'AA-(tha)'; Outlook Stable - National Short-Term Rating affirmed at 'F1+(tha)' - National Long-term unsubordinated unsecured debt affirmed at 'AA-(tha)' - National Long-term subordinated debt affirmed at 'A+(tha)' - National Short-term unsubordinated unsecured debenture programme assigned at 'F1+(tha)' Back to top Thomson Reuters is the world's largest international multimedia news agency, providing investing news, world news, business news, technology news, headline news, small business news, news alerts, personal finance, stock market, and mutual funds information available on Reuters.com, video, mobile, and interactive television platforms.
