Explosive Goldman exit fuels Volcker rule push

A security guard keeps watch at the entrance of King David School High School in suburban Johannesburg, March 15, 2012. Smith was a principled and competitive student, the kind of person whose strong sense of right and wrong probably pushed him to resign from Goldman Sachs in a scathing letter to an international newspaper, his former teacher and coach said. Credit: Reuters/Siphiwe Sibeko By Alexandra Alper WASHINGTON | Thu Mar 15, 2012 11:56pm EDT WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Goldman Sachs resignation letter heard around the world has increased pressure on U.S. regulators to quickly put in place a tough version of the Volcker rule, that forces Wall Street to stop betting aggressively for its own bottom line. Greg Smith became an overnight sensation when the Goldman banker published a withering resignation letter in the New York Times on Wednesday. Smith described his former employer as a toxic Wall Street factory that only thinks about making money, mocking clients by referring to them as "muppets." For reform advocates, the editorial showed that Wall Street failed to learn its lesson after risky trades brought global markets to their knees in 2008. It produced fresh calls to finalize the Volcker rule, the provision in the Dodd-Frank financial oversight law that bans banks' proprietary trading. Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group based in Washington, D.C., issued a statement on Wednesday saying the financial industry had succeeded in getting regulators to delay putting the ban in place, and that Smith's editorial was a wake-up call. "Smith's firsthand account emphasizes that each day of delay prolongs the abuse of Wall Street bankers over their clients," Public Citizen said. The Volcker rule was tucked into the 2010 Dodd-Frank law late in the legislative process. It was seen as an additional way to ensure that banks cannot load up on risky trades that don't help clients and may even put the whole financial system at risk. The rule bans banks that enjoy federal backstops, such as insurance for customer deposits, from proprietary trading. However, it still allows banks to hedge their own portfolios and make trades that are done to serve the needs of clients, known as market-making. Regulators have wrestled with how to distinguish proprietary trading from market-making, a dilemma that Wall Street has seized upon to push for a delay in the rule. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has acknowledged a final rule is unlikely by the July deadline, and two Securities and Exchange Commissioners have said the proposal may need to be scrapped and reworked. U.S. Representative Barney Frank, an architect of the Dodd-Frank law, said Smith's missive goes to the heart of the reform. "The argument this guy is making supports the Volcker rule," Frank said in an interview on Wednesday. "That is the distinction we are trying to make, that the financial institutions are there to service clients, not to serve their own ends," he said. REGULATING ETHICS? Senator Carl Levin told reporters on Thursday that Smith's "extraordinarily strong statement" embodied the spirit of his 2011 financial crisis report that called out Goldman Sachs for betting against clients on mortgage-backed financial products. Levin, who authored the Volcker rule language in Dodd-Frank, said regulators should take the editorial seriously and not weaken the Volcker rule "because they are under bombardment by some of the same forces that opposed Dodd-Frank to begin with." To be sure, the extra pressure does not get rid of regulators' troubles with crafting a workable rule. They have 17,000 comment letters to go through, and Bernanke himself acknowledged there are "a lot of very difficult issues." Karen Petrou, managing partner of Washington-based Federal Financial Analytics, says she is not surprised the column is being seized on to push the Volcker rule, but says she doubts ethical accusations will affect regulatory thinking. A Wall street banking executive, who did not want to quoted, said government should be making decisions based on smart regulation, not emotion. "It would be really horrible to make public policy based on one individual's allegations," he said.

Credit: Reuters/Esam Al-Fetori By Marwa Awad CAIRO | Thu Mar 15, 2012 11:52pm EDT CAIRO (Reuters) - A senior U.S. lawmaker visiting Cairo on Thursday played down the row between Egypt and the United States over pro-democracy activists charged with receiving illegal funds as a "bump in the road" that need not hinder their strategic relationship. Democratic leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, who was leading a delegation including four other senators, said the United States would continue to support Egypt as long as aid enhanced the country's stability. Egypt has accused 43 foreign and Egyptian non-profit workers - including the son of the U.S. transportation secretary - of receiving illegal funds from abroad, carrying out political activities unrelated to their civil society work and failing to obtain the necessary operating licenses. The case has underscored tension between the U.S. and the generals who took power when Hosni Mubarak was overthrown. "The NGO issue was a bump in the road. We have a lot in common with the Egyptian people and want to further their success. We do not intend to have it stand in the way of that," Pelosi told reporters after talks with Egyptian officials. "The interest of Egypt and surrounding areas as well as the U.S. is well served by a strong and stable Egypt. To the extent that that assistance is in furtherance of that stability, we will certainly be there," House of Representatives Democratic leader Pelosi added. The delegation met Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi and parliament speaker Saad al-Katatni, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party. Katatni told Reuters he and Egyptian lawmakers had told the delegation Egypt welcomed strong bilateral relations, but they must be beneficial to both countries and not undermine Egypt's national sovereignty. The lawmakers said the U.S. backed Egypt's negotiations with the International Monetary Fund to secure a $3.2 billion loan after a year of political and economic crisis since Mubarak was ousted. On February 29, Egypt lifted a travel ban on the foreigners pending trial and eight Americans left the country, after calls in Washington for the $1.3 billion in annual U.S. military aid to Egypt to be cut. Some Egyptian politicians denounced Egyptian authorities for bowing to pressure from Washington. Egyptian security forces raided the offices of 17 foreign based NGOs in December, including those of the International Republican Institute, National Democratic Institute and Freedom House.

EU foreign ministers to discuss tanker insurance for Iran oil-source
| Reuters
TOKYO, March 16 | Thu Mar 15, 2012 11:52pm EDT TOKYO, March 16 (Reuters) - EU foreign ministers are expected to discuss how the bloc's Iran oil embargo will impact shipping insurance when they hold a scheduled meeting next week, an industry source said on Friday. The ministers are due to meet in Brussels next Friday. "They are likely to discuss the matter," the source, who had been briefed on the issue, said. Starting in July, European insurers and reinsurers, who provide cover for most oil tankers globally, will be prohibited from indemnifying ships carrying Iranian crude and oil products anywhere in the world in line with the sanctions on Tehran. Both Japan and South Korea, major buyers of Iranian crude, have been holding talks with the EU over the insurance prohibition out of concern it will make it difficult to secure deliveries of the oil.

Lisa Marie Presley digs up southern roots for new album

Credit: Reuters/Nikki Boertman Thu Mar 15, 2012 11:47pm EDT (Reuters) - Lisa Marie Presley pays homage to her southern heritage in new album "Storm and Grace" set for release in May after a five-year hiatus from the music industry, Universal Republic record label said on Thursday. "Nothing was planned or contrived in any way, and out of it came a very organic record that was always inside of me and that I am incredibly proud of," Presley said in a statement on Thursday. The only child of late rock 'n' roll legend Elvis Presley, Lisa Marie kicked off her music career with a 2003 debut album "To Whom It May Concern." It was followed by 2005's "Now What," and both hit the top 10 of the Billboard 200 album chart. The singer's third album, "Storm and Grace," harks back to Presley's southern roots, and was produced by Grammy-winning country producer T Bone Burnett, who was curious to work with "the daughter of an American revolutionary music artist." "What I heard was honest, raw, unaffected and soulful. I thought her father would be proud of her. The more I listened to the songs, the deeper an artist I found her to be," Burnett said in a statement, calling Presley "a Southern American folk music artist of great value." Presley, who found herself in a "considerably disheartened and uninspired state creatively," wrote the album over an eight-month period in England, working with artists such as Richard Hawley from Brit band Pulp and Fran Healy of the group Travis. The album is due for release on May 15.

Rice shoulder a cause for concern after title win

Australia's Stephanie Rice swims during the women's 400m Individual Medley final at the 2012 Australian Swimming Championships to qualify for the 2012 London Olympics, in Adelaide March 15, 2012. Credit: Reuters/Regi Varghese By Ian Ransom ADELAIDE | Thu Mar 15, 2012 11:44pm EDT ADELAIDE (Reuters) - Triple Olympic champion Stephanie Rice was dealing with a painful shoulder on Friday and had it strapped following her 400 meters individual medley win at the Australian Olympic trials in Adelaide. Rice, who posted an impressive time four seconds shy of her world record to win the evening final on Thursday, had arthroscopic surgery on the shoulder in December and has been troubled by it in the leadup to the trials. Her fitness concerns place her under a cloud ahead of the 200 individual medley on Saturday, but her coach Michael Bohl played them down. "It's just like a precautionary thing I suppose, her shoulder pulled up a little bit sore from last night, nothing bad but the physio just decided to strap it to keep her body posture aligned a little bit more," he told reporters. "She was pretty happy with what happened last night obviously and I think she's now gearing up for the 200 medley tomorrow. "She got a little bit of pain last night, she wasn't able to swim down very well after her race last night. It was just a little bit sore this morning." Rice, who also holds the Olympic 200 individual medley gold, previously had surgery on the shoulder in 2010 and can do little but grin and bear the pain right through to London. "The big problem is she's got a hole in her tendon and to get that fixed up properly she'd have to have pretty major surgery," Bohl said. Rice's national title win was a timely return to form and made her the first Australian swimmer to qualify for London.
