Credit: Reuters/Stringer By Kevin Yao BEIJING | Sat Mar 17, 2012 11:43pm EDT BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economic policy priority is to maintain relatively fast growth, but Beijing cannot lower its guard against inflation risks, the head of the country's top planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, said on Sunday. "First of all, we need to maintain steady and relatively fast economic growth -- development is the key for resolving all problems in China," Zhang Ping, NDRC chief, said in a speech. Zhang said the government would maintain prudent monetary and pro-active fiscal policies, and stand ready to fine-tune settings -- a consistent refrain from China's leaders since the autumn of 2011. He added that the growth versus inflation trade-off was a key policy challenge. "It's a dilemma to stabilize growth and stabilize inflation. Even though inflation has showed signs of stabilization, we cannot lower our guard against price rises," he said. "Currently, the situation concerning prices is still severe -- global liquidity is ample and global commodity prices are fluctuating at high levels. Pressures on prices will stay over the long term." China's annual rate of inflation cooled to 3.2 percent in February, bringing it below the government's 4 percent target for the first time in more than a year, but policymakers remain particularly sensitive to elevated commodity prices, given China's huge imports of raw materials. Statistics bureau data on Sunday showed that home prices fell 0.1 percent in February from January for a fifth consecutive month and are widely expected to continue declining, underscoring the success of efforts to curb speculation. Premier Wen Jiabao said on Wednesday home prices were still far above a reasonable level and he would keep property tightening measures place in 2012. China's trade balance plunged $31.5 billion last month into its largest deficit in at least a decade. Import growth of 39.6 percent on the year in February was the strongest in a year and more than twice the rate of export growth. COMMODITY BUBBLE RISKS China's top officials worry that huge injections of liquidity by U.S., U.K. and euro zone central banks to stabilize economies still struggling to overcome the aftermath of the 2008/09 financial crisis, are fuelling a speculative bubble in commodity prices. Meanwhile, economists expect China's annual economic growth to slow to close to 8 percent in the first three months of 2012, down from 8.9 percent in the last quarter of 2011. That would be the fifth successive quarter of slower growth and leave China on track to end the year with its weakest expansion in a decade. Premier Wen cut the official 2012 growth target to 7.5 percent earlier this month, down from the 8 percent targeted in each of the last eight years, in part to create leeway for reforms to underpin domestic demand and reduce dependence on exports and inflows of foreign capital. Zhang said China faced many challenges in striking a balance between promoting economic growth, adjusting economic structures and controlling inflation. Investment is still important for supporting economic growth and the government will open up the railways, the financial sector, the power industry, education services and medical care to private investment, he said. Fixed asset investment, which accounted for 54 percent of China's economic growth in 2011, grew 21.5 percent in the first two months of 2012, slightly ahead of the 20 percent forecast. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in February shrank from a year earlier, a fourth straight fall, with anemic inflows from Europe an additional sign that the People's Bank of China may have to act to ensure steady money supply growth. China drew in $7.7 billion in FDI in February, down 0.9 percent on the same month in 2011, while January and February combined saw FDI flows fall 0.56 percent from a year earlier to$17.7 billion.

Sat Mar 17, 2012 11:35pm EDT * Economic development key to resolving all China's problems, Zhang says * Policy dilemma is to stabilise inflation and growth * Current price risks are severe, commodity costs high, global liquidity ample By Kevin Yao BEIJING, March 18 (Reuters) - China's economic policy priority is to maintain relatively fast growth, but Beijing cannot lower its guard against inflation risks, the head of the country's top planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, said on Sunday.

Credit: Reuters/Handout By Daniel Wallis CARACAS | Sat Mar 17, 2012 11:34pm EDT CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan authorities detained 12 members of an investigative police unit on Saturday suspected in the fatal late-night shooting of a Chilean diplomat's teenage daughter while she was riding in a car with her brother. Karen Berendique, the 19-year-old daughter of Chilean consul Fernando Berendique, was killed late on Friday when the officers opened fire on the vehicle being driven by her brother in Venezuela's western city of Maracaibo, officials said. She was hit three times. Venezuela's Interior Ministry, which is responsible for the police, said 12 officials from the CICPC (national investigative police) had been detained and a criminal investigation launched. "The government ... expresses its condolences and regrets to the Berendique family, and guarantees that those responsible will be punished with absolute firmness and objectivity," the government statement added. A local newspaper quoted her father as saying the officers opened fire after his son failed to stop at a CICPC checkpoint. "He got nervous because the armed suspects had not switched on their police lights," Panorama newspaper quoted Berendique as saying. "When he saw his sister was unconscious and wounded, he pulled over ... they told him they fired because he didn't stop." CICPC chief Jose Ramirez told reporters the officers in Maracaibo had been looking for a gang involved in robberies and car thefts at the time of the incident. He said 12 firearms had been seized to establish who fired the fatal shots. "We condemn and reject this kind of police malpractice," he said. Chile's government in a statement condemned "most energetically the death of Karen Berendique at the hands of agents of the CICPC" and called for an explanation as soon as possible. The statement added that Chile had received multiple expressions of concern from senior Venezuelan officials. Violent crime is a major problem in Venezuela and police have been linked to serious offenses in the past. Public safety will be a big issue in October's election when President Hugo Chavez is seeking a new six-year term in office. Last November, another Chilean consul was shot and beaten during a two-hour kidnapping in Caracas. In January, the Mexican ambassador and wife were abducted in the capital for several hours.

Thorpe's London dream over after 100m flop
| Reuters
Australia's Ian Thorpe gestures while speaking to the media after the men's 200m freestyle semi-finals at the 2012 Australian Swimming Championships to qualify for the 2012 London Olympics, in Adelaide March 16, 2012. Credit: Reuters/Regi Varghese By Ian Ransom ADELAIDE | Sat Mar 17, 2012 11:10pm EDT ADELAIDE (Reuters) - Ian Thorpe's rushed comeback bid for a third Olympic Games ended in ignominy on Sunday as he crashed out of the morning heats of the 100 meters freestyle at the Australian trials in Adelaide. The five-times Olympic champion, who also failed to secure a spot in the 200 freestyle earlier in the trials, won his heat but finished 21st in the timings behind pace-setter and world champion James Magnussen in his last-chance saloon for London. The 29-year-old's time of 50.35 seconds was his best since returning to competition in November, but was more than two seconds shy of Magnussen's and left him well outside the top 16 that will compete at the semi-finals in the evening session. On Friday, Thorpe described his failure to qualify in the 200, his best chance for London, as a "fairytale turned nightmare", but was somewhat less dramatic as he contemplated the final nail in the coffin for his Olympic dream. "This is... it's tough. It's hard coming to this competition and really, you know, failing in what I set out to do," he told reporters at the South Australia Aquatic and Leisure Centre. "I'm disappointed that I really haven't been able to race in a way that's reflective of the work that I've done and how I've trained. "But I don't regret giving this a go. Compared to how I've raced before, how I've competed and the success that I've had, this does look like doom." "But I'm glad I was willing to put myself out there to give this a shot. I'm pleased with that part, and disappointed that it hasn't been the result that I wanted." The headline act at the trials, Thorpe took a long time to exit the pool after winning his heat, the ninth of 12, and walked into the bowels of the arena to await his fate. In the end there was little suspense, as almost all of the remaining swimmers smashed the 50 second mark to leave the swimmer a spectator at London, little more than a year after announcing his return to the pool. "Thorpie's been someone I've always admired as a swimmer, so it is upsetting for him and the rest of us to do feel his pain," Olympic gold medal favorite Magnussen told reporters. "It would have been great to have him there in London, it's disappointing that he's not going to be there, but all I can do now is focus on my race." On Friday, Thorpe failed to reach the final of the 200 freestyle, a result that left a packed crowd stunned and left the swimmer hugely disappointed. The 11-times world champion's 200 bid was easily his best chance to qualify for London and although he put on a brave face after that failure, he conceded he was battling against the odds to break into the top six of the 100, which would have given him a chance of selection for the relay team. TRAINING REGIME The exit of the main attraction sucked the enthusiasm out of the crowd for the morning's remaining heats and counts as an embarrassment for Swimming Australia, which has been under fire for funding Thorpe's expensive training regime in Switzerland. "Right from the outset it wasn't about London, per se," Australia head coach Leigh Nugent told reporters. "London was part of his plan with what he wanted to achieve, but that part isn't going to come to fruition. But the part of swimming beyond London is just validated is what he intends to do and he indicated that in late October." Nugent said Thorpe has only returned to elite training in September, leaving him only six months to prepare for the trials. "He almost got there, but he couldn't quite make it. He needs another six or seven months to then go into another highly intense training that he's used to and that his body responds to. "So what he attempted was incredibly difficult and coming here and doing what he's done is an achievement in itself, but it's part of a bigger process. "He's (still) got it, he's such a magnificent swimmer." Samantha Hamill qualified fastest into the semi-finals of the 200 butterfly ahead of twice-Olympic medley relay champion Jessicah Schipper, while Olympic silver medalist Brenton Rickard set the pace for the semi-finals of the 200 breaststroke. Triple Olympic champion Stephanie Rice will bid to qualify for the Olympic 200 individual medley in the final in the evening session after already winning the 400 IM title on the opening day of the trials.

UPDATE 2-Olympics-Thorpe's Olympic dream shattered at trials
| Reuters
Sat Mar 17, 2012 10:39pm EDT (adds Thorpe quotes, details) * Five-times Olympic champion flops in 100 freestyle heats * Finishes 21st to miss out on semi-finals * London Olympics dream over By Ian Ransom ADELAIDE, March 18 (Reuters) - Five-times Olympic champion Ian Thorpe conceded his towering standing in swimming might be diminished by his failed bid to qualify for the London Games on Sunday, but said it would spur him on to strive for success and erase the disappointment. Thorpe's Olympic ambitions ended in ignominy when he crashed out of the morning preliminaries of the 100 metres freestyle at Australia's national swimming trials in Adelaide. Thorpe, who also failed to secure a 200 freestyle berth earlier in the trials, was 21st fastest behind pace-setter James Magnussen, leaving him outside the top 16 that will contest the semi-finals at the South Australia Aquatic and Leisure Centre in the evening session. That signalled the end of the headline act's participation at the trials and his bid for a third Games - little more than a year after announcing his comeback with the aim of qualifying for London. When asked whether his failure might hurt his imperious record, the 11-times world champion responded: "Possibly. When I started this I realised that was a risk, that I would damage what people's memories were of what I did," Thorpe, revered at home as Australia's greatest Olympian, told reporters. "It's something that I didn't care that much about. I was happy to put it at risk because I saw more value in doing this and trying it out, than whatever I would do to those accomplishments that I had before. "I think most people can understand that. "I think what people often forget is we have this image of people who've had great success and we want to hold them in that position and we tend to forget that they love doing what they do and they forget the joy that it brings to those people. "So I was happy and I am happy just to get back into the sport and being involved in it and being able to race again and I've got a lot of joy out of it." Thorpe's time of 50.35 seconds was his best since returning to competition in November, but was more than two seconds shy of pace-setter James Magnussen's 48.26, and sucked the enthusiasm out of the crowd for the remaining heats of the morning.  WELL SHORT "Thorpie's been someone I've always admired as a swimmer, so it is upsetting for him and the rest of us to do feel his pain," world champion Magnussen said. "It would have been great to have him there in London, it's disappointing that he's not going to be there, but all I can do now is focus on my race." On Friday, Thorpe failed to reach the final of the 200 freestyle, a result that left a packed crowd at the South stunned and the swimmer hugely disappointed. Thorpe had said it would be a battle to qualify in the six fastest swimmers of the 100 freestyle and so it proved it to be. The 29-year-old won his heat, the ninth of 12, and took a long time to exit the pool before walking into the bowels of the arena to await his fate. In the end, there was little suspense as almost all of the remaining swimmers smashed the 50 second mark to leave the swimmer well short. Thorpe quit in 2006, disillusioned with the grind and the relentless glare of the spotlight but said he now, conversely, enjoyed swimming more after his rare taste of failure. He re-iterated his plans to continue and said he would not rule out bringing the 400 freestyle back into his training regime, an event he took gold at the 2000 Sydney Games and defended at Athens four years later. "Failing at something is a great motivator," said Thorpe. "It's pretty obvious it's just not a pleasant thing to go through. "To go through the disappointment, like other people who will experience the heartache of not reaching their goals, you know it does become an extra kick along that you have. "That you can then use in your training for your next preparation." A suggestion about another Olympic bid for the Rio Games in 2016 drew a broad, if wry, grin. "There's some good examples of older swimmers that are swimming well," he said. Lumpy (Michael Klim) is here, Skippy (Geoff Huegill) is here... I'm younger. I'm not going to rule anything out at the moment."

Growth China's top priority, inflation key risk-NDRC

Global economy on recovery path, risks remain -IMF's Lagarde
| Reuters
BEIJING, March 18 | Sat Mar 17, 2012 9:26pm EDT BEIJING, March 18 (Reuters) - The global economy has stepped back from the brink of danger and signs of stabilisation are emerging from the euro zone and the United States, but high debt levels in developed markets and rising oil prices are key risks ahead, the IMF said on Sunday. "The global economy may be on a path to recovery, but there is not a great deal of room for manoeuvre and no room for policy mistakes," IMF Managing Director, Christine Lagarde, said in a speech in Beijing. She said signs of stabilisation were emerging to show that policy actions taken in the wake of the global financial crisis were paying off, that U.S. economic indicators were looking a little more upbeat and that Europe had taken an important step forward in solving its crisis with the latest efforts on Greece. "On the back of these collective efforts, the world economy has stepped back from the brink and we have cause to be more optimistic. Still, optimism must not lull us into a false sense of security. There are still major economic and financial vulnerabilities we must confront," Lagarde said. The IMF chief cited still fragile financial systems burdened by high public and private debt persists advanced economies as the first of three major risks and said euro zone public sector and bank rollover funding needs in 2012 were equivalent total about 23 percent of GDP. "Second, the rising price of oil is becoming a threat to global growth. And, third, there is a growing risk that activity in emerging economies will slow over the medium term," she said. Lagarde also said youth unemployment should be tackled and that all countries must persevere with their policy efforts if the progress made in stabilising the global economy is to pay off with better prospects ahead. She said advanced economies must continue with macroeconomic support and a balanced fiscal policy, together with financial sector reforms and structural and institutional reforms to repair the damage done by the crisis and to improve competitiveness. Meanwhile emerging market economies need to calibrate macroeconomic policies both to guard against fallout from the advanced economies as well as to keep overheating pressures in check.
