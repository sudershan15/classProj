Text:U.S. solar power growth jumps to new record
| Reuters
By Matt Daily March 14 | Tue Mar 13, 2012 11:59pm EDT March 14 (Reuters) - The U.S. solar industry installed a record number of panels in 2011, more than double 2010, and is likely to see strong growth again this year, according to a new report. Solar installers built 1,855 megawatts of photovoltaic projects in 2011 for a total of $8.4 billion, up from 887 MW in 2010, according to a report released by GTM Research and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). The growth in U.S. demand comes as the makers of the panels that turn light into electricity have struggled to earn profits amid a glut of supplies on the global market that eroded margins. The WilderHill Clean Energy Index, which includes shares of industry heavyweights First Solar, Suntech Power Holdings, Yingli Green Energy and Trina Solar, tumbled 49 percent in 2011. So far this year it has rebounded about 12 percent. A record level of fourth quarter installations totalling 776 MW easily beat the peak of 473 MW recorded in the third quarter of the year. "The U.S. was a strong market in 2011 and we expect it to be strong again in 2012," said GTM Managing Director Shayle Kann. Many industry analysts had reduced their forecasts last year to between 1,500 to 1,700 megawatts as incentives waned in the country's two biggest markets, California and New Jersey. For 2012, GTM and SEIA said new construction would grow 35 to 50 percent, reaching 2,500 to 2,800 MW, as a backlog of large projects is completed. The 2011 figures rank the United States as the fourth largest solar market in the world behind Germany, Italy and China, according to Kann. The U.S. share of the global market was only about 7 percent last year, he said, but that share should double by 2016 as U.S. demand continues to grow and European demand starts to decline. The large, utility-scale projects, which produce power for the wholesale electricity market, totaled 758 MW of the 2011 total. That is about the size of one natural gas-fired power plant. Another 3,000 MW of utility-scale plants are currently under construction in the United States, and 6,000 MW is at an earlier stage of development, the report said. Among those projects under construction are two 550-MW projects being built by First Solar and a 250-MW plant being built by SunPower Corp, which are among the largest in the world. Installations on homes rose 11 percent in 2011 to 297 MW, while panels installed at non-residential sites rose 28 percent to 800 MW. Despite declining prices for solar panels in recent years, the sector still relies on government subsidies to make the power projects competitive with coal and natural gas. The average installed cost for solar declined by 20 percent last year to $4.08 per watt, largely because of reductions in costs for the largest plants, which saw costs drop to $3.20 per watt in the fourth quarter. That overall decline did not fully reflect last year's 50 percent drop in wholesale panel prices, since most of the 2011 project costs were before that steep decline. The 2011 panel price drop is likely to begin showing up in projects that will come on line later this year.

PetroChina chief says fuel prices should be raised
| Reuters
By Chen Aizhu and Su Dan BEIJING | Tue Mar 13, 2012 11:59pm EDT BEIJING (Reuters) - China should raise gasoline and diesel prices to reflect the recent surge in crude oil prices, a top executive with China's leading oil and gas firm said on Wednesday, the latest industry official to ask for an increase. Any price increase would be the second so far this year and would raise China's fuel prices to fresh highs, raising concerns about inflation just as the economy slows down. "My feeling is that prices should be adjusted: 22 working days have passed and crude prices have gained more than 10 percent," Jiang Jiemin, chairman of both China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) and PetroChina (0857.HK)(601857.SS), told reporters on the sidelines of China's parliament meeting. According to China's fuel pricing formula, the government may consider lifting fuel prices if a moving average price for a basket of crudes rises over 4 percent in a month. But Beijing, worried about inflation, often postpones raising prices, meaning refiners often run at a loss as they are unable to pass on any increases in their crude oil costs to consumers. China last raised gasoline and diesel prices by 3-4 percent on Feb 8. Crude oil prices have gained about 9 percent in the following month, but the government has held off announcing any changes during the parliament meeting, which ends on Wednesday. Some analysts said the government could raise gasoline and diesel prices by at least 400-500 yuan a tonne, or about 5 percent. Chinese oil firms make a profit on oil and gas production, fuel sales and chemical businesses but their refineries bear the brunt of losses caused by government price controls.

Olympics-Calm Trickett eyes more pool gold at London
| Reuters
By Ian Ransom ADELAIDE, March 14 | Tue Mar 13, 2012 11:57pm EDT ADELAIDE, March 14 (Reuters) - Libby Trickett's infamous attacks of nerves at the Olympics have included feeling like vomiting on the morning of her gold medal-winning swim in Beijing, but the 27-year-old now feels a liberating calm as she contemplates qualifying for a third Games at London. The triple Olympic gold medallist heads into Australia's national trials this week in Adelaide as one of a clutch of former champions desperate for last one tilt at the Games after cutting short their careers to focus on life outside the pool. Despite not setting the world on fire with her times since coming back in 2010, Trickett feels quietly confident on the eve of the 100 metres butterfly preliminaries where she will battle world silver medallist Alicia Coutts and former world champion Jessica Schipper for one of two Olympic berths. "I feel, to be very clichéd, almost successful now just to be here," Trickett, who won the 100 butterfly gold at Beijing to capture a long-awaited individual title, told reporters at the South Australia Aquatic and Leisure Centre in Adelaide on Wednesday. "It's so rewarding the journey that I've been on. The fact that I am as lean as I was in 2008, I'm stronger than I was in 2008 I think I have the potential to be as fast as I was. "That's pretty rewarding in itself coming from where I started. Obviously the next goal for me is to make the Olympic team." Trickett needs to finish in the top two of the butterfly final to guarantee a spot for London, but has a better chance in the 100 freestyle, where a top six performance will at least ensure consideration for the relay team. Trickett retired at the end of 2009 at the age of 24, citing fatigue with the grinding, individual sport, but was lured back to the pool nine months later. Her comeback road has not always been smooth and she was crushed with disappointment after failing to make Australia's ultra-competitive team for the world championships in Shanghai. The eight-times world champion was nonetheless buoyed by a solid swim last month at state championships, where she posted a time of 54.87 seconds in the 100 freestyle, almost a second better than her post-retirement best. Yet to reach her peak form, Trickett said the break had nonetheless made her a better swimmer. "I think if I had have kept swimming (after 2009), I would have had a real bitterness and I think I probably would have regretted that more," she said. "I went through so many things personally, emotionally and mentally during that time off that I know that I'm better for it now and I think I'm a better athlete because of that." Despite dominating her events for more than five years, Trickett has rarely exuded bullet-proof confidence, and opted for caution after colossal disappointments at her first Olympics at Athens in 2004. In the lead-up to the Games she broke Inge de Bruijn's 100 freestyle world record during the semi-finals of the Australian trials and despite being upset by compatriot Jodie Henry in the final she was seen as a favourite for the title for the blue-riband event at Athens. At the Games, however, nerves got the better of her and she failed to make the final, which Henry won, though she was a member of the gold-medal winning 4x100 freestyle relay team. Trickett has stopped short of calling the Australian trials her last stand, but said the call of motherhood was becoming hard to resist and might trump her desire to re-assert her rule over the pool. "I would like to swim on until at least the end of this year, potentially do the World Cup tour and also the world short-course championships, that's my dream at the moment," said the 27-year-old. "I can see myself still swimming because I'm really enjoying the sport, I'm very passionate. "I have a real love of what I'm doing right now but at the same time I've got this biological clock that's ticking, so I would really like to start a family as well. "Whether I can balance the two or have to decide one or the other way, I'm not sure what will happen."

Britain wants transition in Syria, not revolution

Credit: Reuters/Lewis Whyld/Pool WASHINGTON | Tue Mar 13, 2012 11:44pm EDT WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Britain wants to see a transition of power to the opposition in Syria rather than a revolutionary overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad, Prime Minister David Cameron said late on Tuesday. Syria's violent crackdown on rebel areas and how best to galvanize a response to it will feature in talks between Cameron and U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington on Wednesday, although military action is not seen as appropriate for now. The United Nations says more than 8,000 people have died in a year-long uprising against President Bashar al-Assad's authoritarian rule and 230,000 Syrians are estimated to have fled their homes. "We're all frustrated by Syria. What's happening in Homs is completely appalling. I'm endlessly kicking the tires and asking what else can be done," Cameron told reporters. "The shortest way of ending the violence is a transition where Assad goes, rather than a revolution from the bottom." While the United States and European nations were prepared to impose a no-fly zone to aid Libyan opposition fighters in their successful rebellion against Muammar Gaddafi, Britain fears doing so in Syria would prove to be a more complicated and difficult task. Arming rebel groups has also been ruled out for now, with Obama and Cameron eager to increase the pressure on Assad to step aside through diplomatic means and through economic sanctions. The Syrian parliament said Assad had ordered a legislative election for May 7, to be held under a new constitution. Both Russia and China have welcomed Assad's reform pledges, including the promised election, and have blocked moves in the United Nations to censure the Syrian leader. UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan is believed to have told Assad he wanted an immediate cessation of hostilities, humanitarian access to conflict zones and political dialogue. (Reporting by Matt Falloon; editing by Todd Eastham)  Interesting! The armed groups should now drop their weapons – purchased and supported by some philanthropist, close down its ‘Syrian Observatory for Human Rights’ and send out a couple of Rolls Royces to the guys it now selected to be the ‘legitimate’ Syrian government. … and so the dream goes on in the search for a way out from the mess the US, France and Britain created for themselves in Syria. Initially, that is back in April 2011, it was determined that a few skirmishes with the Syrian Army would yield two results in the alignment of the Syrian people behind the ‘Syrian National Council,’ which is to say, US, France and Britain. The second was that the Syrian Army would immediately drop its arms and head off to the nearest recruitment office of the “Free Syrian Army,’ again, of a similar origin, finance, direction and support. When such a ‘revolution’ did not happen, and given that the majority of the Syrian people went to the safety of their homes, having seen the Muslim Brothers who own the ‘National Council’ waging a war that has nothing with their demands. This meant that the US, France and Britain should concentrate on defeating the Syrian Army. Of course the US, France and Britain have what appeared to them to be efficient claws in the region, the ‘democratic’ Saudi ruling family, and the ‘freedom-loving’ sheiks of Qatar. Together they waged a political, military and a propaganda campaigns. It stopped at nothing. Not even stopping their proxy armed groups from sitting within population centers and firing at a modern, sophisticated army. The US, France and Britain entertained the hope that the threat of reducing Syria to Iraq and Libya would be enough, again, to attract the population to the ‘National Council’ and demoralize the Syrian Army. For various reasons this was not to be, one of which is the Russian and Chinese vetos and its significant impact on Europe – who imports 60% of its natural gas from Russia, and on the US, which needs Chian’s money to maintain its war in Afghanistan and its generous allowance to the 1% amongst its citizens! The events in Homs meant that the Syrians are calling the bluff. The US, France and Britain, as every kidergarten child could tell, are in no position to go for a war that lasts for months, and lead to heavy losses in materiel and men – Syria is neither Iraq nor, indeed, Libya! Is it surprising now that the US, France and Britain are left with nothing to save their face and put forward to their ‘National Council’ apart from demanding a transfer of power to the Syrian Opposition by ‘peaceful means.’ What is even more interesting is the assumption that the Syrian Opposition represents the Syria people. Apart from the fact that they have no popular basis to speak of, none of the nine or ten groups, apparently made of few tens of members, have any popular base in the country. Even the Muslim Brothers ‘National Council.’ Its Islamist leaders have not set foot in Syria since the last time they tried exactly the same gambit in the 1980s. Further, there are reasonably credible signs that the majority of the Syrian people are still backing their government. Some 8 million Syrians out of 14 million electorates voted in the plebiscite a month ago. Of course, claims that the 8 million were coerced into participating was often repeated – but it would be quite an event to see 8 million people being forced to take part in a franchise when the state is busy conducting military activities and repelling intense political pressures, and attempting to keep the country running despite onerous and unforgiving economic blockade! Not 8 million, may be 7?, 6?, 4? 1? These are disfranchised by the British Prime Minister, just as Balfour did the Palestinians a century ago! There is no morality, no understanding of democracy and freedom, which permits substituting the Syrian government by an imposed other, which what? Lock up the millions of supporters of the previous one in jail? Murder them all? Well, they did do some of that in Libya under the nose of the liberators. A precedent exists, one supposes! Sometimes echoes of the past are hard to dismiss. But 19th Century colonialism died in the 20th Century, even if resurrecting that fiendish system is the only way out for a confused and inapt politicians in the US, France and Britain. If the British Prime Minister declines to help start a genuine political dialogue in Syria, amongst the Syrians, AND peacefully, the sufferings of the people of Syria forces one to ask him to ‘keep quiet.’ He is not helping!  After all you don’t want to destroy the thing you’re trying to steal right?? Does a safe cracker pour explosives inside the safe he’s trying to open???

Bain Capital defends business in face of Romney attacks

Romney's presidential bid has led to political attacks on Bain, the firm he ran from 1984 to 1999, at a time of high U.S. unemployment and growing income inequality. In a letter to investors on Tuesday, the Boston-based firm said it had created hundreds of thousands of jobs in its 28-year history and supported hundreds of charities. Bain said less than 5 percent of the companies it invested in filed for bankruptcy and pointed to the "growth trajectory" of its portfolio, with over 7 percent revenue gains and $4.1 billion in realized profits from its funds in 2011. Bain said its companies have seen revenues rise by more than $105 billion globally since its investment, including $80 billion of growth in the United States, and that its firms currently employ over one million people worldwide. "While not every business can be successful, any fair-minded assessment must also take into account the jobs preserved in the businesses that we have turned around, transformed and then grown," Bain said. Romney, leading the Republican presidential race, has cited his years at Bain as proof he is a good economic manager at a time when the U.S. economy is struggling to recover. But Romney's opponents have portrayed Bain as a corporate raider which profits at the expense of average Americans. Bain investors contacted by Reuters, including some of the largest U.S. public pension funds, have said political attacks have made no difference in their assessment of Bain and that their focus is on returns and the fees they are being charged. In the letter to investors, Bain said it had "a great deal of respect" for those who pursue public service, citing Romney, but added the private equity firm was separate from politics. Bain's managing directors thanked investors for their support amid "sensationalist rhetoric and political noise". "Many of our managing directors and employees make individual decisions to support causes and political candidates espousing a range of views, but we assure you that Bain Capital itself is separate from politics," they wrote. "Mark Twain's famous witticism, 'Get your facts first, and then you can distort them as much as you please,' has unfortunately become a hallmark of today's political process," they added. Romney has opened a big lead in delegates in the Republican race to pick a challenger to U.S. President Barack Obama in the November 6 election, but he is struggling to capture the hearts of conservatives who distrust him for some of the moderate stances he took as governor of liberal Massachusetts.

U.S. deports Iranian arms broker arrested in 2007 sting

Amir Hossein Ardebili, a weapons procurement agent from the Iranian city of Shiraz, was arrested during a U.S. undercover operation in the Republic of Georgia in October 2007. Ardebili, 38, pleaded guilty in 2008 in a U.S. court in Delaware to attempting to buy restricted military-grade radar, gyroscopes and cockpit computers deployed in the F-4 fighter jet. U.S. officials kept the case secret for years after the 2007 arrest, seeking to exploit the sales data found on the laptop computer Ardebili had brought with him from Iran. He was covertly extradited to the United States in early 2008, and U.S. prosecutors did not make the case public until late 2009. Ardebili's release this week did not appear to be connected to a prisoner exchange. His sentence expired on February 8, records show. U.S. officials briefed on the matter said the Iranian spent the last month in a Minnesota county jail undergoing a routine deportation review. The Ardebili case has drawn the ire of Iranian officials who have asserted that his arrest, detention and extradition to the United States violated international law. Tehran lodged a complaint with the United Nations, and the foreign ministry repeatedly cited Ardebili as one of eight Iranians unjustly held by the United States. American officials have said the case helped expose the manner in which the Iranians use middlemen to illegally procure U.S. military components for their depleted military. According to shipping records and emails, Ardebili often circumvented a U.S. embargo by using a transshipment company in Dubai and banks in Germany and Switzerland. U.S. officials said that the Ardebili case was significant because it represented the first time law enforcement agents successfully lured an arms broker from Iran to a third country, and then extradited him back to the United States. OPERATION SHAKESPEARE The undercover investigation, code named Operation Shakespeare, began in 2004, with queries from Ardebili for aircraft parts and radioisotopes to a Pennsylvania arms brokerage, according to officials. The American firm was actually an undercover storefront operated by agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, part of the Homeland Security Department, officials said. In 2007, Ardebili agreed to meet three undercover U.S. agents in Tbilisi, Georgia, expecting to acquire the radar components and gyroscopes. During the meeting, which was secretly videotaped, an agent asked Ardebili why Iran was so eager to obtain the radar technology. To defend against an expected American attack, Ardebili responded. "They are making special radar ... phased array radar for protection," he said on the videotape. "They think the war is coming." Ardebili was held in Tbilisi for four months, until the Georgian Supreme Court ordered him extradited to the United States. American prosecutors kept the case under seal for 22 months and held Ardebili in solitary confinement under a false name until December 2009, records show. Although Ardebili pleaded guilty, he later said in an interview from prison that he regretted the decision. He had been tricked by the Americans, he said. He called the case against him an "elaborate hoax and plot." In a letter to Georgian officials that he shared with Reuters, he wrote, "You may wish to dismiss me as some common criminal. I am quite positive that the opposite is true. ... The callous disregard of human life and rights, not to mention the shame and pain you caused my family is near unforgiveable." Two U.S. officials briefed on the matter said that Ardebili's deportation moved with unusual swiftness. The Iranian government provided a new passport, suit and wristwatch, and U.S. agents escorted him to Europe, where he was scheduled to catch a KLM flight to Tehran, the officials said.

David Albright, founder of the Institute for Science and International Security, said he studied commercial satellite imagery and found a building located on a relatively small and isolated compound at Parchin that fit a description in the November 2011 International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report. The building has its own perimeter security wall or fencing and there is a berm between the building and a neighboring building, Albright said in a report. The compound is located more than four kilometers away from high-explosive related facilities at Parchin which the IAEA visited in 2005, Albright's report said. Iran refused access to Parchin, southeast of Tehran, during two rounds of talks with IAEA inspectors. Western diplomats say Iran may be delaying access to give it time to sanitize the facility of any incriminating evidence of explosive tests that would indicate efforts to design nuclear weapons. "We have information that some activity is ongoing there," IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano said recently, referring to Parchin. The IAEA has evidence that the test chamber was placed at Parchin in 2000 and that a building was subsequently constructed around it, Albright's report said. The information was that a large explosive test chamber was used to conduct experiments possibly related to the development of nuclear weapons in the early years after 2000, Albright said. He was not able to gauge the level of activity at this particular site without comparing it to multiple images over a short period of time.
