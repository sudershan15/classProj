Text:ING puts $775 million Thailand bank stake on block: sources
| Reuters
TOKYO - Shares, gold and oil fell and the euro remained pressured on Wednesday as Greece struggled to form a government two days after an election, heightening the risk that a hard-won bailout deal could be scrapped. | Video WASHINGTON - Hiring by small businesses slowed in April, but there was an increase in the number of employers planning to create new jobs and those reporting they could not find qualified workers to fill job openings. BEIJING/HONG KONG - China reiterated its opposition on Thursday to a European Union plan to limit airline carbon dioxide emissions and called for talks to resolve the issue a day after its major airlines refused to pay any carbon costs under the new law. Thu Mar 22, 2012 11:59pm EDT (Reuters) - ING Groep NV (ING.AS) has put its roughly $775 million stake in Thailand's TMB Bank Pcl TMB.BK on the block as the bailed-out Dutch financial services group pushes ahead with its Asian divestments, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. ING recently hired an investment bank to help find a buyer for its 31 percent stake in TMB Bank, the sources added, underscoring the seriousness with which the Dutch company wants to pursue the auction. ING and TMB declined comment. The sources declined to be identified as the matter was not public. ING bought the stake in Thailand's seventh-largest lender in 2007 for 460 million euros ($607 million). The Thai government, which owns a 26.1 percent stake in TMB, has said in the past that it wants to sell its entire stake. ING, which received a 10 billion euro Dutch government bailout during the financial crisis, is expected to sell its Asian insurance and investment management business in a deal estimated to be worth over $6 billion.

UPDATE 1-Florida man to plead guilty in celebrity hacking case
| Reuters
Thu Mar 22, 2012 11:43pm EDT (Adds details, background) By Dan Whitcomb LOS ANGELES, March 22 (Reuters) - A Florida man accused of hacking into the email accounts of film stars Scarlett Johansson, Mila Kunis and other celebrities to access nude photos and private information has agreed to plead guilty to federal charges, U.S. prosecutors said on Thursday. Christopher Chaney of Jacksonville, Florida, will plead guilty on Monday to nine criminal counts, including unauthorized access to a computer and wiretapping, according to a plea agreement filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. The charges carry a maximum sentence of 60 years in prison, although federal sentencing guidelines often call for less time behind bars. Chaney was arrested in October after an 11-month investigation dubbed "Operation Hackerazzi" by the FBI. He was charged with 26 counts of cyber-related crimes for hacking into the e-mails of Johansson, Kunis and pop star Christina Aguilera. Other victims were identified only by their initials: B.P., J.A., L.B. and L.S. The photos of Johansson, 27, showed her topless and in a towel with an exposed backside. Johansson revealed in a Vanity Fair magazine interview they were taken for her now former husband, actor Ryan Reynolds, when they were still married. Leaked photos of Kunis showed her in a tub filled with bubbles, showing only her face. In the plea agreement, prosecutors say that between November of 2010 and October of 2011 Chaney hacked into the accounts of more than 50 people in the entertainment industry. He obtained private communications, photos, business contracts, scripts and other information from his victims, prosecutors say. According to the plea agreement he forwarded some of the private photos to another hacker and two gossip websites. Chaney's defense attorneys could not be reached for comment on Thursday evening. The day after he was arrested, Chaney told a Jacksonville, Florida TV station that he became addicted to prying into the affairs of celebrities and apologized. "I was almost relieved months ago when they (the FBI) came and took my computer ... because I didn't know how to stop," Chaney told the TV station.

Nikkei set for biggest one-day fall in 2 months
| Reuters
By Dominic Lau TOKYO | Thu Mar 22, 2012 11:35pm EDT TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei average fell 1 percent on Friday, on track for its biggest one-day percentage drop in two months on concern over global economic growth after data pointed to slower factory activity in China and the euro zone's two largest economies. Fears of slower growth lifted the yen, further weighing on Japanese exporters. Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) lost 1.6 percent, Honda Motor Co Ltd (7267.T) slid 2.1 percent and Sony Corp (6758.T) retreated 2.6 percent. By the midday break, the Nikkei .N225 was down 99.36 points at 10,027.72, while the broader Topix .TOPX declined 0.9 percent to 854.43. The yen was last traded at 82.888 to the dollar after hitting a one-week high of 82.329 on Thursday, well off an 11-month low of 84.187 on March 15. However, market participants said the selloff offered buying opportunities for longer-term investors who remained upbeat on the outlook for Japanese equities. "If there are names you like, you should pick them up from here, especially names that are heavily down today," said a trader at a foreign bank, citing life insurers, and food and beverage counters among his picks. The insurance sector .IINSU.T shed 1.7 percent and the foods sub-index .IFOOD.T eased 0.2 percent. Despite Friday's sell-off, the benchmark Nikkei is still up 18.6 percent this year, boosted by a run of strong U.S. economic data and accommodative monetary policies by global central banks. Foreign investors extended net buying of Japanese equities for a 12th straight week, with a net inflow of 287.5 billion yen ($3.49 billion) for the week through March 17, the highest since April last year. Deutsche Bank said there were still pockets of good value in Japanese shares, especially among exporters, following the bounce. "Even after the rally, there are some interesting value opportunities in Japanese equities and for patient investors we find more distressed value in Japanese equities than in the credit-stricken European equities," Deutsche said in a report. "The new story is that we may now be facing a structural change regarding the multi-year strengthening of the yen." According to Thomson Reuters Datastream, the Topix carries a 12-month forward price-to-book ratio of 0.98, much cheaper than the S&P 500's .SPX 2 and the STOXX Europe 600's .STOXX 1.39. Underscoring investors' upbeat outlook, the Nikkei volatility index .JNIV rose 1.5 percent to 20.32 on Friday, way below this year's peak of 24.61 hit on March 1. The lower the volatility index, the higher the risk appetite. Trading volume on the main board after the morning session was 47.4 percent of its full daily average for the past 90 days. NOMURA DOWN AGAIN Financials were down on Friday as investors took profit on this year's rally, with Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (8316.T) and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (8306.T) down 1.4 and 1.6 percent respectively. Nomura Holdings (8604.T) lost 3.1 percent, extending this week's losses to more than 6 percent as its internal controls come under scrutiny after sources said an employee at Japan's top investment bank was involved in an insider trading case. Japan's securities regulator has recommended a fine against Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc (8309.T) unit, Chuo Mitsui Asset Trust and Banking, alleging that one of its fund managers sold Inpex Corp (1605.T) shares after a tip-off about its $6 billion share issue plans. "Of course the allegations of Nomura's involvement in the insider trading case is negative to their reputation and to the wider industry," said Yoshihiko Tabei, chief analyst at Kazaka Securities. "But the stock is up so much this year and this incident is just one catalyst for investors to take profits." Nomura shares are still up more than 62 percent this year.

CORRECTED-Romney rivals draw on Etch A Sketch line, toy sales soar
| Reuters
Thu Mar 22, 2012 11:33pm EDT  By Michelle Conlin March 22 (Reuters) - Mitt Romney's presidential hopes may have been shaken up when an aide compared his campaign to an "Etch A Sketch" toy, but the publicity blitz has been a delightful surprise for the U.S. makers of the well-known erasable children's art tablet. Ohio Art, the low-key, family-run company that has made "Etch A Sketch" for half a century, saw its sales of the toy soar 1,556 percent above normal levels on Amazon.com within 24 hours of the gaffe. The company's thinly traded stock more than doubled, to $9.65. Senior Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom was speaking about what would happen if Romney won the Republican nomination and faced President Barack Obama in the November election when he drew what has become an unfortunate comparison for Romney. "You hit a reset button for the fall campaign," Fehrnstrom told a CNN interviewer on Wednesday. "Everything changes. It's almost like an 'Etch A Sketch'. You can kind of shake it up, and we start all over again." Romney's rivals - Republicans and Democrats alike - seized on the comment as proof the Republican frontrunner was a flip-flopping waffler whose positions on issues such as healthcare were not to be trusted. His Republican opponents gleefully waved the $12.99 red plastic toy, which lets children m ake drawings they can then erase by shaking it. "I am not the 'Etch A Sketch' candidate!" Romney challenger Rick Santorum declared to supporters. "Etch A Sketch" mania has erupted online, the toy triggering a reaction normally reserved for the likes of the Kardashians. It elbowed out NFL star Tim Tebow on Yahoo's Top 5 searches and swept Twitter's top slot for two days running. On television, "Etch A Sketches" took over cable newsrooms. "I wish we could erase the U.S. debt," one commentator wisecracked as he fumbled with the plastic knobs. For Ohio Art, the attention has been manna from toy heaven. "It's kind of like a Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinsky amount of media interest," says Bill Southard, who has been doing Etch A Sketch's promotions for the past 18 years. "This is the kind of publicity flurry you usually only see in a crisis or a product malfunction." Ohio Art President Larry Killgallon was sitting in a meeting in the Chicago office of Bruce Lund, the inventor of last year's hit toy, "Doggie Doo", on Wednesday. Suddenly, Killgallon noticed his iPad, which he covers in an "Etch A Sketch" case, was being blitzed with emails, and his similarly clad iPhone started ringing. "I've never seen anything like this," said Killgallon, dazed from a 24-hour publicity blitz. "Our target audience is four-to-eight year olds." Larry runs Ohio Art with his brother, Bill, and his son, marketing head Martin. The first "Etch A Sketch" rolled off Ohio Art's production line on July 12, 1960, back when Larry and Bill's dad was helping run the place. By the 1990s, production had moved to China and "Etch A Sketch" remains Ohio Art's number-one selling toy. In between interviews, they decided to send each candidate a box of etch a sketches, but the Obama administration missed out. Larry Killgoran describes the clan as right-leaning but free-thinking. "It's like the 'Etch A Sketch'. There's both a left and a right knob and if they work together they can draw a circle," Killgoran says of the U.S. political situation.

Caterpillar to Expand Shandong Engineering Machinery (SEM) Product Line and Increase Capacity for SEM Wheel Loaders
| Reuters
Thu Mar 22, 2012 11:30pm EDT  PR Newswire QINGZHOU, China, March 22, 2012 QINGZHOU, China, March 22, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) announced today investments in new products and additional capacity for Shandong Engineering Machinery (SEM), its wholly-owned, Chinese construction equipment company.  These investments will transform SEM from a leading Chinese wheel loader manufacturer to a leading provider of a wide range of construction equipment.  SEM currently produces wheel loaders, motor graders and paving products. With today's announcement, the company is adding a line of SEM-branded track-type tractors and will again add capacity for wheel loaders. Caterpillar Chairman and CEO Doug Oberhelman announced the expansion plans in Qingzhou at an event attended by senior Caterpillar leaders and representatives from the Qingzhou government. "China has the largest construction equipment market in the world, and based on China's multi-year plan for continued infrastructure development and economic growth, we are continuing to invest in our operations in China to support our customers and to grow our business," Oberhelman said.  "Because of the unique nature and size of the Chinese market, our investments include our Cat-branded products and with this announcement, additional growth and expansion for our SEM brand." Since purchasing SEM in 2008, Caterpillar has invested significant resources to develop new wheel loader models with improved product quality and reliability while increasing production capacity.  With this latest announcement, Caterpillar will have nearly tripled SEM wheel loader capacity by 2014 when all wheel loader expansion plans are expected to be completed.  In addition, the company plans to build a new facility at the SEM manufacturing campus to begin production of SEM-branded track-type tractors for the Chinese market and for export to some growth markets.  Initial production of SEM-branded track-type tractors is expected in late 2012, with production ramping up through 2013 and 2014. "We recognize that Chinese customers have different needs across the span of the construction equipment industry and because of that, we will continue to expand our SEM product offerings," said Paul Blackburn, SEM general manager. "The combination of our Cat-branded products and services and the continued growth of our differentiated SEM product line uniquely positions Caterpillar to deliver on its long-term strategy for success in China, which is based on serving our Chinese customers better than our competitors," said Kevin Thieneman, Caterpillar country manager for China, India and ASEAN. The expansion plans at SEM are subject to certain governmental agreements and approvals. About Caterpillar: For more than 85 years, Caterpillar Inc. has been making sustainable progress possible and driving positive change on every continent. With 2011 sales and revenues of $60.138 billion, Caterpillar is the world's leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives.

Koch Reacts: Orchestrated Votes at Cato Board Meeting Reveal True Intent of Cato Management
| Reuters
Thu Mar 22, 2012 11:29pm EDT  PR Newswire WICHITA, Kan., March 22, 2012 WICHITA, Kan., March 22, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- In a Cato Institute board meeting held this afternoon, actions orchestrated and implemented by Cato management demonstrated their strategy and intent to wrest meaningful involvement in the organization away from shareholders Charles Koch and David Koch. In an attempt to execute their own takeover plan, Cato's chairman, Bob Levy, sent critical board resolutions to board members last night at approximately 9:30 p.m. Eastern, subsequently demanding a vote on each resolution the next day.  At today's board meeting, board members supportive of Ed Crane voted as a block to change the bylaws and reinstate four past board members. Along with the vote, Cato management pushed through a resolution for the formation of a special litigation committee, refusing to include current Cato board members, former United States Solicitor General Ted Olson and Judge Andrew Napolitano, for membership on the committee. According to Charles Koch, co-founder of Cato Institute, "The actions taken by Cato's management are intended to assert their domination of Cato, exclude those who are not supportive of Cato's CEO, and gut the intent of the shareholder agreement. That is why we filed the declaratory judgment in Kansas seeking to confirm the meaning of Cato's governing documents. We have consistently sought to resolve our differences in a constructive manner. Today's actions of Cato's management at today's board meeting are evidence of their rejection of any reasonable compromise," said Koch. Koch did not comment on the next steps he and David Koch are considering.
