Text:Bloomberg charity boosts global anti-smoking effort
| Reuters
Wed Mar 21, 2012 11:59pm EDT * $220 million more for anti-smoking campaign worldwide * Legal support offered to counter pushback by industry * Countries follow NYC example, tobacco profits hurting By Sharon Begley NEW YORK, March 22 (Reuters) - Michael Bloomberg's charitable foundation will commit an additional $220 million over the next four years to fighting tobacco use globally, including funding for legal challenges against the tobacco industry by countries such as Uruguay. The New York City mayor was set to announce the new funding for Bloomberg Philanthropies on Thursday at the 15th World Conference on Tobacco or Health in Singapore. His charity will monitor the tobacco industry's strategies and offer legal support to counter its pushback against anti-smoking campaigns. Calling tobacco "a scourge all over the world" and accusing cigarette makers of "nefarious activities," Bloomberg said at a news conference on Friday that his foundation will focus on low and moderate-income countries where nearly 80 percent of smokers live, like Russia, China, India, Indonesia and Bangladesh. That marks a departure from Bloomberg's efforts since 2007, which have been funded with $375 million from the billionaire mayor's pocket. Until now, his anti-smoking campaign has focused on "what's worked here" in New York City, said Dr. Kelly Henning, director of the charity's public health programs. That included pressing local and national governments to raise cigarette taxes; persuading the entertainment industry to deglamorize smoking by not filming movie stars smoking; making nicotine patches widely available; and, lobbying for laws that ban tobacco advertising, sponsorship and smoking in public. Such strategies have worked. In New York City, the adult smoking rate has reached an all-time low of 14 percent, the Health Department announced last September. That is 35 percent below the rate in 2002, when the department began its anti-smoking efforts. By comparison, the national smoking rate is 19.3 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  FOLLOWING NYC EXAMPLE The New York City example is starting to be adopted overseas. Earlier this month, India increased its cigarette tax. "We've been doing tax advocacy in India for the last year and have now seen 12 states raise their state-level value-added tax on cigarettes," said Henning. "This increase is at national level. We consider it a small step forward." Bloomberg Philanthropies' campaign has also led to laws banning smoking in public places, including workplaces and restaurants, in Brazil, Turkey and Pakistan, and cities such as Jakarta, Mexico City and Harbin City in China. Working with ministries of health and non-governmental organizations, the charity has helped win the passage of laws in 11 countries mandating graphic images on cigarette packs. In the United States, the government and tobacco industry are battling in court over whether a similar law is constitutional. But the global fight is growing fiercer as new regulations threaten industry profits overseas. To counter a decline in smoking in the United States, cigarette makers have relied on higher prices, cost cuts and growth in smokeless tobacco to keep profits rising. They have also targeted overseas markets, especially in China, Indonesia, and Russia, where a growing middle class can pay up for branded products. Altria Group's 2008 spinoff of Philip Morris International gave investors a choice between a sustainable cash return in the United States or growth prospects internationally. According to the Tobacco Atlas, released Wednesday by the American Cancer Society and the World Lung Foundation at the tobacco congress, the tobacco industry reaped profits of $35 billion in 2010, "equivalent to $6,000 for each death caused by tobacco," the groups said in a statement.  PHILIP MORRIS VS URUGUAY As anti-tobacco policies and laws are extended in the world - they currently cover 2.2 billion people - they threaten cigarette makers' profits and the industry is fighting back. "The industry does its work in the dark of night to undermine legislation and keep marketing to kids and all the other nefarious activities they do," Bloomberg said. Bloomberg Philanthropies is working against that trend by helping Uruguay, for example, battle Philip Morris. In 2009 the South American country adopted a law requiring that warning labels cover 80 percent (the most in the world) of the surface of cigarette packs, and that each brand have only one variant (no "lights," menthols or other brand extensions), among other restrictions. In response, Philip Morris International and three affiliates filed an official complaint against Uruguay with the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes, part of the World Bank, alleging that the restrictions harmed the tobacco firms' business operations and violated a bilateral investment treaty between Uruguay and Switzerland, where two of the affiliates are based. "We have supported and will continue to support effective and sensible tobacco regulations," Philip Morris International said in a statement to Reuters. "The Uruguayan regulations we are challenging are neither. For example, as a result of the regulations we had to stop selling seven of our 12 brand variations in Uruguay. In the case of Marlboro, the regulation meant that the Gold, Blue and Green variations representing about 40 percent of Marlboro sales had to be taken off the market. ... We had no option but to seek legal recourse." Bloomberg is underwriting legal assistance for Uruguay and helping it hire expert consultants to assist with filings, said Henning. "If industry wins this one, other countries will be terrified of adopting anti-tobacco measures," she said.

TEXT-S&P Bulletin: No Rating Impact On State Bank Of India
| Reuters
Wed Mar 21, 2012 11:51pm EDT (The following was released by the rating agency) MUMBAI (Standard & Poor's) March 22, 2012--Standard & Poor's Ratings Services said today that its rating on State Bank of India (SBI; BBB-/Stable/A-3) is not affected by a recent announcement that the government will inject Indian rupee (INR) 79 billion of capital into the bank. We believe SBI's capital and earnings will remain at "moderate" levels, after the infusion, which will increase its capital base by about 8%. We may raise our initial projection of the bank's pre-diversification risk-adjusted capital ratio, but it is likely to stay within a range of 5%-7% over the next 12-18 months. That's because we expect SBI's profitability to remain subdued in fiscal 2012-2013 (ending March 31), and the bank is likely to need additional capital to support its current asset growth. On the other hand, we believe that a recent weakening in the bank's loan quality could pressure our current "adequate" assessment of its risk position. This could, in turn, strain the bank's stand-alone credit profile (SACP), which we assess at 'bbb'. Nevertheless, our issuer credit rating on SBI has an adequate cushion to absorb some slippage in loan quality. We believe it is unlikely that the existing 'bbb' SACP will fall to 'bb', which is our rating downward trigger.

Protestants on the rise as pope visits Mexico

Credit: Reuters/Edgard Garrido By Ioan Grillo LEON, Mexico | Wed Mar 21, 2012 11:50pm EDT LEON, Mexico (Reuters) - Worshippers jumping about in church, waving their hands to the swell of keyboards and electric guitars is not a sight any pope would hope to find in Mexico, for long one of the world's most devout Roman Catholic countries. But when Pope Benedict visits the city of Leon in Mexico's Catholic heartland this weekend, the growing strength of Protestant groups will be on view just hundreds of meters from where he will meet with bishops and the Catholic faithful. The leader of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics arrives in Mexico to find a Church struggling to keep its flock. Over the last decade, the number of Catholics leaving the fold has posted its biggest surge in modern Mexican history as more and more put their faith in evangelical Protestantism or the book of Mormon, or turn away from religion altogether. At one evangelical service in Leon this month, worshippers yelled out to banish their demons in a style reminiscent of the U.S. Bible Belt. Hymns were backed by rock guitars, the faithful leaped up and down and an elderly woman added to the music by blowing through an enormous curved animal horn. Some say they are attracted to the evangelical services because they are more exciting than solemn Catholic masses. Others say they have been turned off Catholicism by child abuse scandals, which have hit several dioceses in Mexico in recent years. The Church's problems in Mexico reflect a broader decline across much of Latin America. Brazil and Mexico are the world's most populous Catholic countries. Juan Pablo Barrera, a 32-year-old leather trader from Leon, says he left the Catholic faith two years ago because evangelicalism touched him more deeply, and that his new beliefs have helped him deal with anger and become a better father. "The Catholic Church never taught me to have a personal relationship with God," Barrera says. "It told me that the pope, the Virgin, the saints and the priests were more important." Even among the Catholic majority, many are also breaking the rules of Rome. Only about half of Mexican marriages are blessed by the Catholic Church, according to government records, and birth control is widespread. Liberal social policies have gained ground despite Church opposition with both abortion and gay marriages now legal in Mexico City. And in a country ravaged by a drugs war that has killed about 50,000 people in the last five years, hundreds of thousands of Mexicans who consider themselves Catholic today venerate a female skeletal grim reaper known as Santa Muerte, or "Holy Death", despite objections from their priests and bishops. 'HISTORIC CHANGE' More than 99 percent of Mexicans professed to be Catholics when Mexico held its first modern census in 1895 and even by 1970, 96 percent still pledged allegiance to Rome. But that dropped to 88 percent by 2000 and then to 82.7 percent in 2010 - the sharpest decline since the census began. "This is a moment of historic change in religious beliefs in Mexico," says Elio Masferrer, an expert on growing religious diversity. "If this trend continues, there will be some Mexican states where the majority are not Catholic by 2020." The decline is all the more remarkable given that since 2000, Mexico has been ruled by the socially conservative National Action Party, or PAN, which has traditionally had a strong Catholic identity. The PAN ended 71 years of rule by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which was born of the Mexican revolution and at times repressed the Church. Vicente Fox, the first PAN leader to become Mexican president, celebrated his faith and kissed Pope John Paul II's ring during a papal visit in 2002. The current president, Felipe Calderon, also publicly attends church services and will meet Benedict on this visit to rally Mexico's Catholic faithful. But even the PAN has had to respond to changing times among its own supporters, says Luis Felipe Bravo, the party's former chairman and once Mexico's ambassador to the Vatican. "We have a very large number of activists who belong to evangelical churches or who don't have any religious beliefs," Bravo told Reuters. "It's part of the face of modernity." Within this, atheists now count for 4.6 percent of Mexicans, and are particularly influential in the capital, where a leftist government promotes birth control and gay rights. Guanajuato, where Benedict will ride in the pope-mobile and conduct a huge outdoor, remains Mexico's most Catholic state, with almost 94 percent following the faith. Built around silver mines of the Spanish empire and thriving industry today, Guanajuato is largely free of the drug violence plaguing much of Mexico, easing the pontiff's security concerns. Even here, though, the number of Protestants has doubled in the last decade, and in Leon alone there are now more than 130 registered groups of evangelical Christians. PLANTING SEEDS While many are small flocks of 50 to 100 people who hold services in rented spaces, some have huge congregations. The "Trigo y Miel" or "Wheat and Honey" association holds Sunday services for about 1,000 faithful in a converted shoe factory in a working class Leon neighborhood. During its services, a live group mixes tropical and pop music to hymns while a throng of red-clad dancers click their feet in mid-air. The proceedings are relayed on gigantic video screens all around the building, even in the bathrooms, and suited security guards keep order at every corner. The cheerful atmosphere contrasts sharply with religious divisions elsewhere in Mexico. In the southern state of Chiapas, the conversion of some indigenous groups to Evangelical Protestantism has caused inter-faith violence since the 1970s. In Guanajuato, the conflict has been restricted to a war of words at the pulpits and parishes. "The Catholic priests criticize us, they demonize us, they call us sects," says Roberto Cetina, a pastor in Leon. "But we just keep on growing and planting new seeds." Catholic officials retort that the even with the decline, Mexico boasts 92.9 million Catholics. The fact that so many have remained faithful to Catholicism despite the competition deserves recognition, said Jose Guadalupe Martin, the archbishop of Leon, who will be hosting the pope during his weekend visit. "The Catholic Church doesn't impose its convictions on anybody. If somebody chooses to join another group that's fine because we have religious freedom," Martin said. "We don't worry so much about quantity but more the quality of Catholicism."

UPDATE 1-Raymond James warns Morgan Keegan financing costs to hurt
| Reuters
Wed Mar 21, 2012 11:50pm EDT * Feb assets under management $38 bln * Morgan Keegan integration will close on April 2 March 21 (Reuters) - Raymond James Financial Inc warned on Wednesday that financing costs for its acquisition of Morgan Keegan would hurt this quarter's earnings but added 98 percent of Morgan Keegan's advisors that got retention incentive offers will stay with the firm. Raymond James agreed to acquire Southeast investment bank and brokerage Morgan Keegan from Regions Financial Corp for $930 million in its largest acquisition ever, seeking to expand its brokerage and capital markets business at a bargain price. To finance the purchase, it has issued new stock and made two senior note offerings, including one announced earlier on Wednesday. "Although the offerings executed to date were on favorable terms, they will unfavorably impact this quarter's earnings and earnings per share due to both the increased interest cost and common shares outstanding since they took place before the actual acquisition," it said in a statement on February operating data. The acquisition will add about 1,000 advisers to its force, which currently has about 5,400 advisers making it one of the largest U.S. wealth management firms. The integration is on track to close on April 2. The company reported assets under management of $38 billion for the month of February, up from $35 billion last year. Shares of Raymond James closed at $37.24 on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

UPDATE 4-McDonald's CEO Jim Skinner to retire
| Reuters
Wed Mar 21, 2012 11:45pm EDT * Skinner to be replaced by COO Don Thompson on July 1 * Analysts say Thompson likely a safe pair of hands * Share price little changed in extended trading By Lisa Baertlein March 21 (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp Chief Executive Jim Skinner, who took the top post at the world's biggest hamburger chain following the abrupt departures of two CEOs, is retiring after more than seven years as a stabilizing force at the helm. In what analysts expected to be a smooth transition, Chief Operating Officer Don Thompson, 48, will succeed Skinner, effective July 1, becoming one of the most prominent African-American CEOs in the United States. Skinner, 67, has led McDonald's since November 2004 and is widely credited with executing the turn-around of the ubiquitous fast-food chain, whose shares more than tripled while he was CEO. He also will resign from the board of McDonald's. The company did not give a reason for Skinner's departure, but analysts said the move, while not entirely a surprise, came earlier than expected. "My suspicion is that he thinks the company is in a really good spot ... and that with Don, the company is in good hands. He's done what he set out to do," said RBC Capital Markets analyst Larry Miller. "Jim's not going to hang around. That's his style," Miller said, referring to him as a no-nonsense CEO. Analysts said Thompson - who previously oversaw the company's U.S. operation and is credited with its widely successful domestic roll-outs of lattes, frappes and other beverages - should be up to the task. "Don Thompson has proven himself to be an excellent operator and a strong manager, which should help assuage investor concerns," Bernstein Research analyst Sara Senatore said. "Everything Don's done has been a home run," RBC Capital Markets' Miller said. "I don't see McDonald's missing a beat." Shares in the company barely budged in extended trading following the news, slipping 0.1 percent to $96.60.  TOUGH START AT THE TOP Skinner began his career as a restaurant manager trainee in Illinois and quickly worked his way up the ranks of the company's U.S. unit. He joined the McDonald's international management team in 1992 and was vice chairman in charge of McDonald's operations in Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America when he was promoted to CEO - the company's third in one year. McDonald's Chief Executive Jim Cantalupo died of a heart attack in April 2004, shortly before he was to speak to thousands of McDonald's owners and operators. His successor Charlie Bell was diagnosed with colorectal cancer just weeks into his tenure and stepped down in November that same year. Skinner wasn't in the post long when "Super Size Me", a scathing documentary about McDonald's and the fast-food industry, hit theaters. The company ended the practice of super-sizing after a public outcry. It also expanded its menu with low-priced and "premium" food, extended operating hours and remodeled units, moves that contributed to a nearly nine-year run of rising sales at established restaurants. Thompson, a Purdue University alumnus, takes the No. 1 job at a time when the company, valued at close to $100 billion, is outpacing competitors and its stock is trading near record highs. The Chicago native joined McDonald's in 1990 as an electrical engineer. He climbed the ranks to become the company's U.S. president before his elevation to COO in 2010, after which he oversaw overall strategy and operations for more than 30,000 restaurants across the globe. When Thompson - who is often hailed as an African-American role model - was appointed COO, some on Wall Street saw him as a clear front runner to one day run the company.

BlackBerry Partner Fund manager Relay Ventures, formerly ATP, announces second $150M mobile fund
| Reuters
By Devindra Hardawar at VentureBeat Wed Mar 21, 2012 11:43pm EDT ATP Capital, the firm that manages the BlackBerry Partners Fund, Clairmont Capital, and JLA Ventures, is today re-branding itself as Relay Ventures to sex up its image. (And let’s face it, anything is better than three capital letters.) Relay Ventures is also announcing a new $150 million early-stage mobile fund, dubbed the BlackBerry Partners II fund, which will be platform agnostic and independently managed. The fund will be led by Canada’s Northleaf Capital Partners and will see participation from Blackberry maker Research in Motion (obviously), Corus Entertainment, and Thomson Reuters. “This re-branding initiative finally unifies the three brands that we’ve been operating under and the more than $800MM in capital that we’ve raised,” said Kevin Talbot, Relay Ventures’ co-managing partner, in a statement today. “Our new brand brings unity and clarity to our mandate as an early stage venture investor.” Explaining the issue with the firm’s old name, Talbot wrote on the Relay Ventures blog: In addition to ATP being an acronym for the Association of Tennis Professionals and Adenosine Triphosphate (a coenzyme AND the name of a Japanese alternative rock band fronted by a guy named “Mug”), it stood for Albright Talbot Partners. Clearly, it was not our most creative moment and the name never took hold as an umbrella brand for the various funds that we manage, largely because we never knew or understood when to use it rather than one of the other brands we managed. Relay Ventures has been ranked as the third most active fund in mobile and wireless by Ridgecrest Capital Partners, behind Sequoia Capital and Intel Capital. The firm has backed 32 mobile companies (28 of those in the last three years), six of which have been acquired, according to co-managing partner John Albright. Coinciding will all of its new announcements, Relay Ventures will also open an office in Silicon Valley’s Menlo Park. Talbot recently moved to the Bay Area, and he’ll be joined by new  partner John Occhipinti, formerly a partner with Woodside Fund. Overall, Relay Ventures has made 84 investments since 1996, 42 of which have exited through mergers, acquisitions, and by going public. The firm has raised over $800 million so far.

Brent falls below $124 on China demand fears
| Reuters
Wed Mar 21, 2012 11:38pm EDT * China's March factory activity shrinks - HSBC * Surprise drawdown in U.S. crude stocks - EIA * Coming up: Euro zone March flash PMI; 0858 GMT By Francis Kan SINGAPORE, March 22 (Reuters) - Brent crude dropped below $124 a barrel on Thursday, after weak Chinese manufacturing data sparked concerns that energy demand growth could slow at the world's second-largest oil consumer. China's factory activity shrank in March for a fifth successive month, with the overall rate of contraction accelerating and new orders sinking to a four-month low, the HSBC flash purchasing managers index (PMI) showed on Thursday. "It's a surprising reading, and is contrary to improving monetary conditions and a stabilising external conditions," said Natalie Robertson, a commodities strategist with ANZ Bank in Melbourne. "It reflects Chinese demand on the ground, which has a significant impact on commodity markets." Brent crude shed 50 cents to $123.70 a barrel by 0319 GMT, after settling 8 cents up at $124.20 a barrel. U.S. crude was down 73 cents at $106.54. The benchmark rose $1.20 to settle at $107.27 on Wednesday.  HSBC's PMI survey, the earliest indicator of China's industrial activity, fell back from February's four-month high, slipping to 48.1, and is likely to reinforce the more bearish views on China's economic trajectory. "Growth momentum could slow down further amid a combination of sluggish export new orders and softening domestic demand. This calls for further easing steps from the Beijing authorities," HSBC chief China economist, Qu Hongbin, said in a statement. Slowing activity could mean a further relaxation of monetary policy to help underpin growth in the world's second biggest economy, but lingering inflation risks uncovered by the survey highlight the dilemma facing China's policymakers who are determined to keep a lid on prices. The Australian dollar fell and shares in Hong Kong gave up their gains after the data was released. EURO ZONE WORRIES WEIGH Oil prices also came under pressure from renewed worries about the euro zone debt crisis hitting oil demand. Portugal's core public deficit nearly tripled in the first two months of 2012, stoking concerns the country may miss its budget targets and follow Greece in requiring more rescue funds. Investors will now look to manufacturing data in Europe to be released on Thursday, with flash PMI estimates from across the euro zone forecast to show an overall improvement versus February, according to a Reuters poll. But losses in oil prices were capped by data showing U.S. crude stocks fell 1.16 million barrels to 346.29 million barrels in the week to March 16. A Reuters poll of analysts had forecast a 2.4-million-barrel build.. Stockpiles at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery point for the New York Mercantile Exchange crude contract declined 176,000 barrels to 38.52 million barrels, the first drop in four weeks.  IRAN RISK Oil markets continue to be driven by the prospect of supply disruptions from Iran, analysts said. The market is now balancing Saudi assurances that it would make up for any supply shortfalls against the potential risk for the loss of oil from Iran amid tighter Western sanctions on Tehran over its disputed nuclear programme, they added. "The market remains stretched in terms of spare capacity in our view, and it is close to the point where the price-reducing effect of further output increases is likely to be countered by the price-increasing effect of perceived reductions in spare capacity," said analysts at Barclays Capital in a research note. Worries the standoff between the West and Iran over Tehran's nuclear program could hit supplies have lifted Brent prices by around 15 percent this year.

Wed Mar 21, 2012 11:38pm EDT DBS Vickers increased its target price for Singapore's property and food and beverage conglomerate Fraser and Neave Ltd (F&N) to S$7.70 from S$7.20 and kept its buy rating, citing a higher market value of its listed entities.
