Brazil CSN Q4 profit jumps 81 pct on ore, steel sales
| Reuters
Mon Mar 26, 2012 11:59pm EDT * Margins decline in key segments despite forecast-beating results * EBITDA rises 1 pct; jump in expenses pares increase SAO PAULO, March 26 (Reuters) - Brazilian steelmaker CSN reported an 81 percent annual jump in net profit for the fourth quarter, as stronger-than-expected sales of iron ore and flat steel products offset a surge in expenses. The Sao Paulo-based company posted a net profit of 817 million reais ($450 million) for the fourth quarter compared with 450 million reais in the same period of 2010. But that was a 26 percent drop from 1.097 billion reais in the third quarter. The company was expected to post net profit of 733 million reais in the fourth quarter, according to the average estimate of seven analysts in a Reuters poll. Despite the forecast-beating results, operating profit margins in key business segments narrowed, sales expenses soared and net debt climbed. Earnings at its mining unit, CSN's most profitable, came in at the lowest level for the year. Brazil's steel industry is passing through its worst crisis in years, hurt by rising costs of raw materials and soft demand in Latin America's largest economy. Net revenue rose 21 percent on an annual basis to 4.167 billion reais, also beating the 4.079 billion reais estimate in the poll, driven by higher iron ore and flat steel sales, CSN said. But it slid 2 percent from the prior quarter, reflecting lower iron ore prices and a poorer sales mix for steel products in the company's home market. Sales of iron ore surged 25 percent year-on-year to 1.196 million tonnes. Proceeds from steel operations accounted for 56 percent of total revenue, and mining revenue about 39 percent. Sales expenses surged 144 percent annually as production and output of iron ore and steel rose. They also more than doubled from the third quarter of 2011 as iron ore freight costs climbed. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), a gauge of cash generation, rose 1 percent to 1.463 billion reais from a year earlier but fell 14 percent from the third quarter and missed a forecast for 1.504 billion reais. CSN said that a poorer sales mix and rising expenses pushed EBITDA lower. The EBITDA margin, or relation between operating profit and total sales, fell to 35 percent of revenue in the fourth quarter from 42 percent a year earlier and 40 percent in the third quarter.

Brent crude stays above $125 on Fed comments, Iran
| Reuters
Mon Mar 26, 2012 11:52pm EDT * Bernanke comments indicate easy monetary policy to continue * Investors' appetite for riskier assets boosted * Sudan president suspends meeting after clashes with South Sudan By Florence Tan SINGAPORE, March 27 (Reuters) - Brent held steady above $125 on Tuesday as comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve indicating easy monetary policy would remain in place for some time raised investors' appetite for riskier assets. Oil prices also continued to draw support from supply concerns amid tightening Western sanctions on Iran over the Islamic Republic's disputed nuclear programme. Brent crude fell 10 cents to $125.55 by 0302 GMT after gaining 52 cents to settle at $125.65 a barrel on Monday. U.S. crude edged down 5 cents to $106.98. "It was more a reminder that the Fed stands ready to turn on the printing presses again should conditions warrant it," said Ben Le Brun, market analyst with OptionsXpress in Sydney. "All risk assets including oil rallied strongly last night after his comments and this has to a large degree, offset the potential impact from a slowdown in China." Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said the U.S. economy needs to grow more quickly if it is to produce enough jobs to bring down the unemployment rate and this process can be supported by continued accommodative policies. The U.S. central bank has said it would likely keep interest rates near zero at least through late 2014. Investors were expecting a quick reversal of monetary easing following upbeat economic signs. Asian stocks rebounded, after a more than 1 percent gain in Wall Street stocks, while the dollar eased after Bernanke's comments. A weaker greenback makes dollar-denominated commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies.    SUPPLY WORRIES The front-month Brent crude futures have risen about 17 percent so far this year on worries over supply from Iran, while geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Africa have also disrupted crude supplies from Syria, South Sudan and Yemen. Tighter Western sanctions have prompted top Iranian crude buyers, including China and India, to seek supplies from other countries. China Petroleum and Chemical Corp (Sinopec) is looking to diversify its crude oil imports, the company's chairman said on Monday, following a sharp drop in its first-quarter purchases from Iran. Investors have not ruled out the possibility of a military strike by Israel on Iran that could cause oil prices to spike, Jonathan Barratt, chief executive of BarrattBulletin, a Sydney-based commodity research firm. Yet the recent developments such as talks between the United States and the U.K. on a release of oil reserves and the urgency to speed up the construction of the south Keystone pipeline could mean that the world will be well supplied with oil if a strike takes place, Barratt added. Hopes for a quick resumption in South Sudan crude output were dashed after Sudan's President Omar Hassan al-Bashir suspended a planned meeting in South Sudan's capital Juba following clashes between armed forces from both sides on Monday, state media reported. The meeting was aimed at resolving the countries' bitter disputes over oil and border regions and restoring crude production in South Sudan halted since January. Investors will scour U.S. weekly inventories data due later on Tuesday from industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) to assess demand at the world's largest oil user. U.S. commercial crude oil stockpiles were forecast to have risen last week on an increase in imports, a preliminary Reuters poll of analysts showed.

China Jan-Feb industry profits dip as slowdown bites
| Reuters
BEIJING | Mon Mar 26, 2012 11:39pm EDT BEIJING (Reuters) - China's industrial firms suffered a rare annual drop in profits in the first two months of 2012 mainly in petrochemicals, metals and auto companies, the latest signs of weakening momentum in the world's No. 2 economy. Profits fell 5.2 percent so far in 2012, according to the industrial profitability indicator, published by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) every month. The indicator of year-to-date profits covers industrial firms with annual revenue above 20 million yuan and showed a downward trend of industrial profitability in China. The last period that China reported nationwide industrial profit fall was in the first eight months of 2009. Industrial profits in 2011 jumped 25.4 percent to 5.45 trillion yuan ($863.86 billion), or 454.5 billion yuan a month in average, but in the first two months of 2012, combined profits of Chinese industrial firms were only 606 billion yuan, or 303 billion yuan a month. The NBS did not give any reasons for the trend. Profits in the chemical industry fell 28.8 percent, those in ferrous metal processing plunged 94 percent, while automobile manufacturing profits were down 6.5 percent. Enterprises in the sectors of petrochemical, coking and nuclear fuel processing made losses in the first two months of 2012, compared with a profit in 2011, the agency said. Energy exploration firms fared better, with profits increasing 15.5 percent in the first two months; followed by food processing of 13.3 percent as well as power and heating supply of 21.1 percent, the agency said. China's economy is facing stiff headwinds as exports slackened while there are increased signs of softening domestic demand as Beijing keeps up its property tightening measures. The HSBC flash purchasing managers index, the earliest indicator of China's industrial sector, showed that factory activity shrank for a fifth straight month in March, leaving investors fretting about the risks to global growth and anticipating fresh policy support from Beijing.

China financial reform pilot may allow overseas investment: report
| Reuters
SHANGHAI | Mon Mar 26, 2012 11:39pm EDT SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese authorities are finalizing plans for a financial reform experiment that would let individuals in one Chinese city invest in overseas financial assets, local media reported on Tuesday, marking an important step towards liberalization of China's capital account. The "general financial reform zone" pilot project will allow residents of Wenzhou, in Zhejiang province, to invest directly in foreign assets, the 21st Century Business Herald reported, citing a provincial financial regulator involved in developing the plan. However, a separate measure included in an early draft of the plan, which would have permitted steps towards interest-rate liberalization by Wenzhou banks, has been rejected, the paper reported. The rejection of rate reform indicates that senior policymakers remain reluctant to push ahead on more comprehensive financial reforms which could threaten the profitability of the state-dominated banking system and raise the cost of capital to state-owned borrowers. <ID:4E8ED2BN> The foreign investment provision would create a new channel for Chinese retail investors to gain exposure to overseas financial assets, outside of the existing Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) program. Launched in 2006, QDII is currently the main channel through which Chinese domestic investors can invest in overseas capital markets. But China's foreign exchange regulator has so far granted only $75.2 billion in quotas under the program. Wenzhou officials originally submitted a plan for the pilot in October 2011, and the plan has been slowly working its way through the provincial and central government approval processes, during which some of the more controversial provisions were removed, the paper reported. A stand-alone plan to allow overseas financial investment by Wenzhou residents was officially released in early 2011 but then scrapped two weeks later. That plan was subsequently folded into the broader blueprint for the financial reform zone, the paper reported. Other elements of the pilot project will include measures to encourage micro-lending, lending to small- and medium-sized business, and to standardize and legalize various forms of so-called "popular lending" in which residents lend to one another outside the banking system. Wenzhou is famous as a center of private entrepreneurship and grey-market lending. The idea for the financial reform zone emerged in late 2011, after a series of media reports on Wenzhou entrepreneurs who had fled or committed suicide after they were unable to repay high-interest underground loans. Wenzhou business owners had resorted to such loans after normal bank loans became increasingly difficult to obtain amid tight monetary policy in 2011.
