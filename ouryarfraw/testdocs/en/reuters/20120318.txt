Text:RPT-UPDATE 1-Tokyo Steel to raise April product prices by $24
| Reuters
Sun Mar 18, 2012 11:51pm EDT (Repeats to additional subscribers) * Thick plate price remains unchanged * The yen's fall improves market prospects TOKYO, March 19 (Reuters) - Japan's biggest construction steelmaker, Tokyo Steel Manufacturing Co, will raise prices in April by 2,000 yen per tonne for all its products except thick plates, to reflect higher prices in Asia and a weaker yen. Japanese manufacturers' exports and the balance of demand and supply in the domestic steel market are improving fast after the yen weakened last week to an 11-month low against the dollar, Kiyoshi Imamura, sales director of Tokyo Steel, said. "This will become the first of a series of rate hikes if export conditions improve further in the next month," he told a news conference on Monday. The firm had kept prices unchanged for March, when its H-shaped beams were priced at 71,000 yen and also in February, seeking to stem an inflow of cheaper imports. The company's pricing strategy is closely watched by Asian rivals such as POSCO, Hyundai Steel and Baosteel, which have ramped up capacity to feed their own needs. But sluggish domestic markets have prompted them to boost exports to Japan, taking advantage of the weakness of their currencies. Japan's steel imports jumped 22 percent to 4.48 million tonnes in 2011, with those from South Korea growing 30 percent to 2.95 million tonnes, while exports declined 6.6 percent, hit by a strong yen.

Reliance Comm unit files papers for $1.5 bln IPO-paper
| Reuters
March 19 | Sun Mar 18, 2012 11:49pm EDT March 19 (Reuters) - Flag Telecom, controlled by Indian billionaire Anil Ambani's Reliance Communications, has filed initial papers on the Singapore Stock Exchange to raise up to $1.5 billion through an initial public offering, the Business Standard reported. The transaction is likely to be completed by the second week of May, the newspaper said, citing the prospectus filed on Friday. Reliance Communications, India's second-largest mobile firm by users, has long been trying to raise funds by selling assets to cut its debt - $6.9 billion as of December. The company plans to sell 75 percent of the wholly-owned unit, the newspaper said. Deutsche Bank, DBS of Singapore, Standard Chartered and Industrial & Commercial Bank of China are managing the issue, it said. A company spokesman declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Reliance Communications acquired the FLAG undersea cable network for $207 million in 2003, and the business is now part of its Reliance Globalcom unit, which owns the world's largest private undersea cable system spanning 65,000 kilometres. In December 2009, sources had told Reuters that Reliance Communications hoped to raise around $3 billion by selling the undersea cable business. It found no takers.

Foxconn not to take legal action after retraction
| Reuters
TAIPEI, March 19 | Sun Mar 18, 2012 11:46pm EDT TAIPEI, March 19 (Reuters) - Foxconn Technology Group , the top maker of Apple Inc's iPhones and iPads, said on Monday it had no plans to take legal action over a U.S. radio programme about its activity in China, parts of which have been retracted. But the company said the broadcast, which has generated public debate on journalistic ethics in the United States, had hurt its reputation. The radio programme "This American Life" last week retracted an episode critical of working conditions at a Chinese factory of Foxconn, saying it had contained "numerous fabrications". The retracted episode, broadcast on Jan. 6, was based heavily on a one-man theatrical show by actor Mike Daisey: "The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs." "Our client is Apple Inc... Our corporate image has been totally ruined. The point is whatever media that cited the program should not have reported it without confirming (with us)," said Simon Hsing, Foxconn's spokesman. "We have no plans to take legal action... We hope nothing similar will happen again." Working practices at Foxconn's huge plants in China came under intense scrutiny in 2010 after a series of suicides among young workers. Last June three workers died in an explosion at a Foxconn plant in Chengdu, western China. Daisey's play and its attendant publicity, including the radio segment, have played a big role in pressuring Apple to allow outside inspectors at its contract manufacturing facilities in China, mostly owned by Foxconn Technology. The executive producer of "This American Life" said in a broadcast last week that most of the retracted programme's content was true and corroborated by independent investigation. The inaccuracies were linked to the actors' account of his trip to China. Foxconn said recently it had raised wages of its Chinese workers by 16-25 percent from February, the third rise since 2010. Apple, criticised over working conditions at its chain of suppliers in China, said last week that a U.S. non-profit labor group had begun an "unprecedented" inspection of working conditions at its main contract manufacturers. Last month the New York Times published an investigation into working practices at Apple supplier's plants in China that documented poor health and safety conditions and long working hours. At around 0340 GMT, shares of Hon Hai Precision, the group's listed flagship unit, slipped 1.9 percent. Foxconn is not listed as a group. Other Apple supplier also were down, with Genius down 3 percent, while the main index sank 0.31 percent.

Global view improving, risks still to downside: IMF's Zhu
| Reuters
Min Zhu, Deputy Managing Director, International Monetary Fund (IMF), attends a session at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, January 26, 2012. Credit: Reuters/Arnd Wiegmann By Farah Master HONG KONG | Sun Mar 18, 2012 11:38pm EDT HONG KONG (Reuters) - Global economic growth will slow this year, with the United States looking much improved but risks still to the downside as Europe's financial markets remain fragile, the deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund said on Monday. Growth in emerging markets will be strong but the full impact of the slowdown in developed economies has yet to fully filter through to other regions, Zhu Min said at Credit Suisse's Asian Investment Conference in Hong Kong. Recent U.S. economic data "look much improved", although a key challenge is creating strong growth in a deleveraging environment, Zhu said. "Number one, the global growth rate is slowing down. Number two, things are getting better. Number three, the risks are still on the downside," he said. Zhu, a former deputy governor of the Chinese central bank, was speaking a day after IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said the global economy had stepped back from the brink and signs of stabilization were emerging. He said China must rebalance its economy to encourage stronger domestic demand, and added the country's exchange rate must move into a more flexible regime, echoing similar comments by Lagarde on Sunday. Chinese Vice Premier Li Keqiang, also speaking at the weekend, said the world's second-largest economy cannot delay tough economic reforms and promised flexible policies to keep growth brisk and prices stable. Zhu was appointed to the newly created deputy managing director post at the IMF in July, in a move aimed at recognizing China's growing clout in the global economy. The IMF has warned that China's annual economic growth could be cut nearly in half this year if Europe's debt crisis tips the world economy into a recession. Zhu said economic trends and policy in China were pointing to a soft landing for China's economy, which has been one of the few drivers of global growth in recent years. "In Europe, the financial markets are still very fragile," Zhu said. "There is no room for any mistake, any slip-up in the market." The IMF on March 15 approved a 28 billion euro bailout for Greece, warning Athens there was no room for missteps in implementing the economic program. The latest 28 billion euro loan is part of a bigger IMF-EU bailout package after Greece agreed to a series of painful economic reforms, spending cuts and completing a debt swap that imposed losses of as much as 74 percent on private bondholders.

Credit: Reuters/Denis Balibouse SEOUL | Sun Mar 18, 2012 11:34pm EDT SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean carmaker Kia Motors (000270.KS) said on Monday that it would suspend production at its U.S. plant on Monday and Tuesday, after media reported said a fire broke out at a parts supplier. The news sent shares in Kia and parent Hyundai Motor (005380.KS) down on concerns about possible output disruptions. Kia's U.S. plant in Georgia, with an annual production capacity of 300,000 vehicles, produces the Optima sedan, the Sorento SUV and Hyundai Motor's Santa Fe SUV. A South Korean media report said on Monday that a fire had struck a Georgia factory operated by Daehan Solution, an unlisted South Korean parts supplier for Kia. An official at Daehan Solution declined to comment. Kia did not identify the reason for the plant suspension, with a spokesman saying that it would have a limited impact on sales as the facility had an inventory of 1.9 months. "Production is currently scheduled to resume at 6:30 a.m. EDT on Wednesday, March 21," Kia said in a statement. Ahn Se-hwan, an analyst at IBK Securities, said the closure could lead to short-term production disruptions for the Santa Fe and Sorento. Shares in Kia Motors were down 1.9 percent and Hyundai Motor was down 0.7 percent in a wider market .KS11 that was up 0.3 percent as of 0312 GMT. Kia, an affiliate of Hyundai Motor, saw its monthly sales jump 37 percent to a new record high in February from a year earlier.
