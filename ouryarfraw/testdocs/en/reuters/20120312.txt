Mon Mar 12, 2012 11:55pm EDT (Corrects timing of screen installation in paragraphs 1-2) * China's TCL boasts the largest LCD screens * China wants to market brands, not just "Made in China" products By Lucy Hornby BEIJING, March 13 (Reuters) - Two new Chinese LCD screens in Beijing's imposing Great Hall of the People will replace screens made by a Japanese competitor, in a sign of resolve to supply the world with Chinese brands and not just Made in China products. The screens are made by Chinese electronics giant TCL. At 110 inches, they are the world's largest 3-D LCD screens, just a touch wider than the 108-inch Panasonic models they replaced. "We have broken through the Japanese and South Korean monopoly of big flat-screen TVs!" TCL chairman Li Dongsheng boasted at a launch ceremony on Friday. Officials from the Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), and the government of Shenzhen, TCL's hometown, clapped and nodded. The government is encouraging its companies to move up the value chain and develop margin-producing brands, partly as a matter of national pride but also to shift the world's second-biggest economy away from gritty, low-profit manufacturing. But creating recognisable brands has not been easy. With the possible exception of computer-maker Lenovo and appliance maker Haier, China has few brands that foreign shoppers would recognise. Even at home, producers often find themselves supplanted by high-end foreign brands. "That is a big hurdle, especially in autos. (The domestic brands) are almost non-existent in large cities like Shanghai or Beijing because no one wants to be seen going lower than a Japanese or a Korean brand," said James Roy, a senior analyst with China Market Research Group, a Shanghai-based consultancy. Beijing has been ready to lend a hand. This month, MIIT posted new rules requiring officials, who overwhelmingly prefer German luxury brands like Audi, to buy only local cars. Other efforts, including government support for domestic companies engaged in "indigenous innovation", have led to allegations that China is unfairly trying to tilt the playing field towards its own industry by guaranteeing government purchases and by setting standards that favour Chinese companies over established industry leaders. "If Chinese companies want to go global, they can't just compete in a protected domestic market," said Zhao Yuhai, high- and new-technology development and commercialisation director general at the Ministry of Science and Technology. "That way you will never win the global market. So this concern is unnecessary,"  CAR-VING OUT A MARKET For policymakers, overseas presence is a sign that a brand has succeeded. Companies aspiring for international brands should aim to earn one-fifth their revenues and one-third of their profits from sales abroad, Yang Mianmian, the president of the world's largest appliance maker Haier, told the National People's Congress, or parliament, a few years ago. Haier sells compact appliances like washing machines and mini-fridges under its own name in the United States, but still sells in Europe under European brand names. Few other companies have reached even that level. "Some brands have started (to get international recognition), but most need more work," Zhou said. "Of course, there are different kinds of markets, high-end and low-end, and I think brands like TCL are still at the mid-to-low-end stage. But they'll move up." TCL sells under its own name in developing markets, but markets under the Alcatel, Thomson and RCA brands in the West. "To fully sell under our own name isn't a question of technology but of marketing. Because if we promote a new brand, our own brand, it would take time," TCL's Li told Reuters. "If there is already a local established partner, using their brand is quicker. For our company, the most important is bigger sales turning into greater revenue." For many companies those big sales come at home. Unlike South Korea or Taiwan, China's domestic market is big enough that many producers do not yet need to focus on developing international brands, said Roy of China Market Research Group. "That there aren't many Chinese brands that are globally known shouldn't necessarily suggest that Chinese companies don't know how to brand," he said. "The main opportunity for brands has been the domestic market." The auto industry is still a major front in the brand wars. The government hinted to foreign automakers last year that applications to expand joint venture production were unlikely to be approved unless they worked with their Chinese partners to develop Chinese-branded cars. General Motors has since launched the "Baojun" (Treasure Steed), although it denies that it was in response to Chinese government pressure. The policy helps correct what planners now see as a mistake -- although China is the world's largest vehicle market, it lacks the defining national auto brand enjoyed by such smaller markets as Korea, Malaysia, the Czech Republic, even Poland. When China married foreign automakers to its largest state-owned firms, the unexpected consequence was that the joint ventures saw rocketing output, but left the state-owned firms with zero incentive to develop by themselves.

Pfizer says Europe undermining drug innovation

Pfizer, the world's largest drugmaker, projected 2010 earnings below analysts' average forecast, saying the strengthening dollar would crimp earnings. Credit: Reuters/Brendan McDermid By Kate Kelland and Ben Hirschler LONDON | Mon Mar 12, 2012 11:53pm EDT LONDON (Reuters) - Europe is undermining drug innovation by cutting prices, raising barriers to new medicines and freeloading" off others in Asia and the United States who are more willing to pay, the boss of Pfizer, the world's largest drugmaker, said. European governments are sacrificing the long-term future of science in their countries for the sake of short-term budget cuts, chief executive Ian Read told Reuters on Monday. There is a disconnect in Europe between the marketplace for pharmaceuticals and the desire of European governments to have innovation and research," he said in an interview. Europe is not paying its fair share of innovation." Tensions between large drug companies and European governments have been rising for several years as administrations across the region face the challenge of curbing the rising costs of healthcare in tough economic times. Governments are by far the biggest buyers of medicines in Europe, allowing them to dictate prices. The common European practice of cross-referencing to medicine prices in other countries means that exceptional price cuts in Spain or Greece will trigger knock-on cuts elsewhere. Modern medicines for complex diseases like cancer can be hugely expensive and many governments in Europe have also put other mechanisms in place, such as Britain's cost-effectiveness watchdog the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Read hit out at governments who have slashed drug prices and racked up close to $20 billion in unpaid bills for medicines, largely in southern Europe, saying their increasing reluctance to pay up for innovative therapies would come back to haunt them. The pharmaceutical industry requires a vibrant marketplace. It's a high-risk business ... and a high-risk business needs the potential for high returns. So in the end, European leaders are sacrificing the long term for the short term," Read said. GlaxoSmithKline Plc Chief Executive Andrew Witty said last month he now ranked Europe behind the United States and Japan as a market where he would want to launch new products. Bayer AG CEO Marijn Dekkers has also expressed concern about Europe's direction, noting in a recent results presentation that the money earned from today's drugs was needed to pay for developing the medicines of tomorrow. POLISH PRICES FOR GERMANY? Pfizer's Read singled out Germany for particular criticism, pointing to Berlin's recent decisions to extend drug price freezes from 2010, which were initially designed as an emergency measure, and to use a basket of countries including Poland and Greece as a benchmark for how much it will pay for drugs. What is the fundamental message there? They are saying ... investment in innovation is at a level that Greek prices can support," Read said. That's not a recipe to create an innovative industry that can compete on the world stage." Read, who took over as Pfizer chief executive in December 2010 after the abrupt departure of his predecessor Jeff Kindler, said he'd like to see governments taking a longer-term view and engaging on the issue of who should pay for the research and development costs of cutting-edge medicines. Since Germany is one of Europe's wealthiest countries, Read questioned whether referencing its prices to Greek or Polish levels would offer drugmakers a fair return. These are the questions I'd like politicians to look at in a fundamental way," he said. Asked whether such discussions should take place as part of World Trade Organization talks, he said they were not on the agenda at the moment, but probably should be. Eventually I think it will have to be. The risk of freeloading is so great in an industry with sunk costs," he said.

Seoul shares rise to 1-week high on short-covering
| Reuters
Mon Mar 12, 2012 11:41pm EDT * Won strength bolsters confidence, sparks short-covering * Financials rally on active money market flow * Auto counters soar on weaker yen, FTA windfall * Investors eye results of FOMC, U.S retail data By Joonhee Yu SEOUL, March 13 (Reuters) - Seoul shares climbed more than 1 percent to a one-week intraday high on Tuesday, buoyed by short-covering as a rebound in the won against the dollar prompted buying among foreign investors. "The won is poised to break through the 1,200 mark against the dollar, prompting short-covering by foreign investors who are eyeing a foreign-exchange rate boost to their capital margins," said Daishin Securities analyst Ham Sung-sik. "Heavy capital inflows were also seen in programme trading, easing pressure on the index, which has been weighed down by redemptions and settlements on expiring options in recent weeks." The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) was up 1.21 percent at 2,026.83 as of 0323 GMT. Offshore investors were buyers of a net 41.5 billion won ($36.9 million) worth of shares, institutions bought a net 67.1 billion won. Banks rallied across the board as jitters over the Greek debt crisis subsided, and as a strong won pointed to improved risk appetites and an active money market. Shinhan Financial Group Co Ltd climbed 4.66 percent, while Hana Financial Group Inc jumped 4.7 percent. Automobile-related counters were also strong performers, with investors finding bargains in the high-beta sector that has lagged in recent sessions. "These are one of few high-beta stocks that underperformed even when the index rose. With a rebound in the yen weakening Japanese competitors, and the U.S FTA deal set to come into effect soon, they're looking highly undervalued," said Park Young-ho, a sector analyst at Daewoo Securities.

Universal Entertainment Files Counterclaim Against Wynn Resorts
| Reuters
Mon Mar 12, 2012 11:41pm EDT  PR Newswire TOKYO, March 12, 2012 TOKYO, March 12, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Universal Entertainment Corporation, and its subsidiary Aruze USA, Inc., today filed a Counterclaim against Steve Wynn, Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ: WYNN), an officer of Wynn Resorts, and the individual members of the Wynn Resorts Board, to prevent the unjust and improper redemption of shares owned by Aruze USA, Inc., at a 30 percent discount, and to seek damages, punitive damages and treble damages. Universal Entertainment is seeking a permanent injunction, declaratory relief and multiple claims for damages caused by the actions of Mr. Wynn and the Wynn Resorts Board.  The Counterclaim contends that Wynn Resorts' purported redemption violates the express language of multiple agreements between Steve Wynn and Aruze USA, and among Steve Wynn, Elaine Wynn, Wynn Resorts and Aruze USA.  Further, by means of the purported redemption, Mr. Wynn and the other members of the Board seek to profit from their illegal acts in a process that was corrupt and unfair, causing Universal Entertainment and Aruze USA irreparable damages based on an unproven pretext. Kazuo Okada, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Universal Entertainment, said, "We are taking this action to protect our investment from what we believe to be an unconscionable course of conduct perpetrated by Steve Wynn and the Wynn Resorts Board of Directors to facilitate Mr. Wynn's agenda of maintaining his absolute control over Wynn Resorts and in order to enrich himself.  Our lawsuit contends that after having lost control of his previous ventures in Las Vegas, Mr. Wynn has undertaken this campaign to suppress dissenting views on the Wynn Resorts Board, particularly with regard to Wynn Resorts' unprecedented, inadequately explained and wasteful $135 million donation to the University of Macau, so that this venture would not end with the same result." Mr. Okada added, "Our Counterclaim highlights that the Wynn Resorts Board did not exercise any independent judgment or otherwise act in a manner consistent with sound corporate governance principles.  Rather, the Wynn Resorts Board fell in line behind Mr. Wynn and authorized the illegal redemption of Aruze USA's shares following a hurried and incomplete investigation that lacked sufficient findings and any form of due process in accordance with appropriate governance principles and standards. We are confident in the strength of our claims and look forward to bringing them before the Court." No Legal Basis for Redemption Universal Entertainment's Counterclaim contains allegations, among others, that: No Basis for Finding "Unsuitability" The Counterclaim asserts that, even assuming that the provisions of the Wynn Resorts Articles of Incorporation were applicable to the shares held by Aruze USA (which Universal Entertainment argues they do not), the Board of Directors could not have in good faith determined that the standard was met for a finding that Mr. Okada, Universal or Aruze USA is "unsuitable."  Mr. Okada denies that there is basis for the finding by the Wynn Board of Directors that he is "unsuitable".  He says, "Universal Entertainment is a public company in Japan with its own Compliance Committee, which adheres to rules relating to business entertainment so that such entertainment is within industry practices and applicable laws. If we become aware that an employee has violated our rules, we impose discipline." Universal notes that its subsidiary in the Philippines has a provisional gaming license and that the final license will be granted on the condition that the construction of the casino project is completed.  The license comes from building a casino within the designated economic zone for casinos. Universal also notes that the Articles of Incorporation of Wynn Resorts require that the Board believe the person whose conduct is in question is "likely to jeopardize" Wynn Resorts' applications for, or existing, gaming licenses.  This would simply not be the case, as there is no basis under applicable gaming laws for any gaming authority to terminate or withdraw any gaming license or any pending application of Wynn Resorts or its subsidiaries based on the alleged wrongdoings. Steve Wynn, Driven by Desire to Maintain Control and Enrich Himself, Violates Nevada RICO Statutes The Counterclaim states that Mr. Wynn has run Wynn Resorts as a personal fiefdom, packing the Board with friends who do his bidding and paying key executives exorbitant amounts for their unwavering personal fealty to Mr. Wynn, all so that Mr. Wynn is able to continue to dominate and control the company.  The Counterclaim states that, consistent with this goal, Mr. Wynn, along with Kim Sinatra, Wynn Resorts' General Counsel, executed on a scheme of fraud and defamation which Universal Entertainment believe violates Nevada's RICO statutes. As outlined in the Counterclaim, on numerous occasions Mr. Wynn, Ms. Sinatra and other Wynn representatives misrepresented their intentions in an effort to deceive and steal from Aruze USA, and to enable Mr. Wynn to secure and maintain control of Wynn Resorts through a series of fraudulent and deceptive acts.  Notably, they also attempted to force Aruze USA to sell its shares directly to Mr. Wynn at a massive discount and to intimidate Mr. Okada into resigning from the Wynn Resorts Board. Wynn Resorts Board Breached Fiduciary Duties Universal Entertainment believes the Wynn Resorts Board acted hastily and without a good faith attempt to understand the true facts before voting for the entirely unnecessary and improper redemption.  The Counterclaim contends that, through their misconduct and by failing to abide by basic rules of corporate governance, Mr. Wynn and the Wynn Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties and various contractual and other obligations to Mr. Okada, Universal Entertainment and Aruze USA. Universal Entertainment contends that: Furthermore, Universal Entertainment's Counterclaim alleges that the Board timed its actions to divert attention away from questions Mr. Okada raised regarding the Wynn Resorts donation in Macau, which resulted in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry of the company. Freeh Report: Providing a Pretext without Due Process The Counterclaim contends that the report prepared by Freeh Sporkin & Sullivan, LLP, a law firm hired by Wynn Resorts to investigate Mr. Okada, constitutes an effort to create a pretext to carry out the predetermined judgment of Mr. Wynn by providing a rationale for unjustly attempting to take Aruze USA's shares in Wynn Resorts at a severe discount.  The Freeh Report was prepared after only one interview with Mr. Okada and was completed just three days thereafter.  Although promised, Mr. Okada was not afforded any opportunity to provide any documents, explanations or corrections to address the numerous errors and false accusations in the report.  In fact, Mr. Okada was not provided with a copy of the report until after it had become publicly available, despite the fact that Wynn Resorts had furnished it to members of the media well in advance.  Universal Entertainment believes the facts demonstrate that the result was preordained and is seeking to prevent the Wynn Resorts Board from unfairly acting based on this rushed, flawed and inequitable investigation.  No Basis For Discount to Aruze USA Shares Finally, Universal Entertainment alleges in its lawsuit that nothing in the Wynn Resorts Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, or the stockholder agreement among Mr. Okada, Mr. Wynn and Elaine Wynn, provides for or otherwise would justify a 30 percent discount to the value of Aruze USA's investment. According to Wynn Resorts, the valuation was justified based only on the opinion of one of Steve Wynn's long-standing financial advisors.  Universal Entertainment also filed a response to the claims brought by Wynn Resorts, denying the material aspects of the allegations brought by Wynn Resorts, and filed a removal notice to move the case to federal court.  The filings have been made in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada.
