The New Orleans-based U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in a 16-2 opinion that Mississippi's Covington County School District had no constitutional duty to protect the fourth grader from the man who checked her out of school six times, posing as a parent. "Schools are simply not constitutionally required to ensure students' safety from private actors," the court said. Unlike prisons, mental institutions and foster care systems that assume an active role in caring for their charges, schools don't have the same kind of "special relationship" with their students that could give rise to liability under federal law, the court ruled. The student, who was not named, and her relatives sued the school district and several school officials in 2008. Even though the elementary school had a check-out policy allowing only designated adults to pick children up, Tommy Keyes signed the girl out of school and then "brutally and viciously raped" her before returning her to class, the complaint said. Keyes, 38, was convicted of sexual battery and has been serving a 10-year prison sentence in the Winston County Correctional Facility since 2009, according to the Mississippi Department of Corrections website. A three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit ruled last August that the school district did have a special relationship with the girl, due to her young age. But the full court reached the opposite conclusion on Friday, rejecting the federal suit. "Jane's parents were free at any time to remove Jane from the school if they felt that her safety was being compromised," Judge Carolyn King wrote for the majority. Two judges "strenuously" dissented, finding that a school "cannot be permitted to evade its duty to protect its very young pupils while they are in its exclusive custody." Christopher Fitzgerald, a lawyer for the student and her family, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. William Whitehead, who represented the school defendants, said he was satisfied with the ruling. A parallel state lawsuit is still pending in Mississippi, Whitehead said, adding that state law caps damages at $500,000, while federal civil rights law damages are unlimited. The federal complaint had requested at least $78 million in compensatory damages and $143 million in punitive damages.

Utah demands federal government return public lands to state

Credit: Reuters/Jim Urquhart By Debbie Hummel SALT LAKE CITY | Fri Mar 23, 2012 11:45pm EDT SALT LAKE CITY (Reuters) - The state of Utah, long resentful that some 60 percent of its territory belongs to the U.S. government, says the time has come to reclaim the millions of acres it gave up more than a century ago for admission to the union. Governor Gary Herbert signed into law on Friday a bill demanding the federal government relinquish ownership of roughly 30 million acres of public land in Utah by 2015 or face a state lawsuit challenging its continued control of that property. Shrugging off warnings from state attorneys that the legislation, backed primarily by Republicans, is likely unconstitutional and could lead to a protracted but futile legal battle, Herbert called such a dispute "a fight worth having." The measure, opposed by conservation groups, caps years of rising indignation in Utah's conservative political establishment over the fact that about 65 percent of the state's land mass is owned by various federal agencies, the bulk of it by the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management. Critics have complained that federal control over vast tracts of Utah's territory has put too much land off-limits to commercial activities, such as energy development, limiting the state's tax base for schools and other public services. "The director of BLM has more control over our state than the governor," Herbert, a first-term Republican, said at a news conference following a bill-signing ceremony at the state capitol in Salt Lake City. "The federal government retaining control of two-thirds of our land mass was never in the bargain when we became a state, and it is indefensible 116 years later," Herbert added in a statement issued by his office. Herbert and other supporters have focused especially on the potential for greater funding for education in Utah, which ranks near the bottom in per capita expenditures for public school students among the 50 states. COULD AFFECT NATIONAL RECREATION SITES The new law calls on the federal government to transfer title to properties held by the BLM, U.S. Forest Service and other agencies to a Utah public lands commission by January 1, 2015. The state's five national parks, its military installations and some federal wilderness areas are exempt. But the measure would likely affect such sites as the 1.9-million-acre Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and other national recreation sites and wildlife refuges, said Steve Bloch, conservation director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance. Debate over Utah's federal holdings has flared several times since statehood was granted in 1896, but supporters of the newly enacted measure point to recent federal court decisions that they say bolster their case for reclaiming public lands. Their claims are based in part on an interpretation of Utah's century-old enabling act under which they say Congress promised to return federal lands after statehood. Proponents argue that Congress reneged on that promise in a 1970s statute that retained federal land ownership in Utah but pledged greater state control and access as an alternative. Foes of the measure say its supporters are misreading Utah's founding documents and that there is no legal basis for the state to unilaterally claim ownership of federal lands. That has not stopped lawmakers in other big Western states with large federal landholdings, such as Arizona, from pushing for similar measures. Utah state Representative Ken Ivory, the chief sponsor of Friday's bill, said a similar measure has already passed the Arizona state House of Representatives and is awaiting a hearing in the state Senate.

Lawsuit over Martin Luther King documents thrown out

District Court Judge Tom Lee in Jackson ruled in favor of television reporter Howard Ballou, whose mother, Maude Ballou, had worked as King's personal secretary. Lee said the King estate offered no evidence to contradict Maude Ballou's assertion that King gave the documents to her. Maude Ballou said she gave the documents to her son after the death of her husband, Leonard Ballou. The estate said in court documents that Howard Ballou possessed copies of King's speeches, photographs and other important documents that belonged to the private corporation run on behalf of the civil rights leader's family. The documents were discovered in 2007 after the death of Leonard Ballou, who stored them in the basement of the library of Elizabeth City State University in North Carolina, where he worked as an archivist. King, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, was assassinated in 1968 as he stood outside his motel room in Memphis, Tennessee, where he had gone to support striking sanitation workers.

U.S. to appeal WTO ruling against meat labels

Credit: Reuters/Suzanne Plunkett By Doug Palmer and Rod Nickel WASHINGTON/WINNIPEG | Fri Mar 23, 2012 10:10pm EDT WASHINGTON/WINNIPEG (Reuters) - The United States said on Friday it would appeal a World Trade Organization ruling against a law requiring country-of-origin labels on all meat sold in grocery stores, a move that disappointed Canada and Mexico, both of which want the law changed. The meat labels became mandatory in March 2009 after years of debate. U.S. consumer and mainline farm groups supported the requirement, saying consumers should have information to distinguish between U.S. and foreign products. Big meat processors opposed the provision, which they said would unnecessarily boost costs and disrupt trade. A WTO panel ruled in November that the country-of-origin labeling, or COOL, provision violated WTO rules on technical barriers to trade. The case was brought by Canada and Mexico, which have sizeable cattle and hog trade with the United States. Andrea Mead, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative's office, said the November ruling confirmed the United States has the right to adopt mandatory COOL requirements to help consumers make informed purchasing decisions. But "we were disappointed that the panel disagreed with the way that the United States designed its COOL requirements with regard to beef and pork. Accordingly, we are challenging the panel's report before the WTO Appellate Body," she said. In their complaint, Canada and Mexico said cattle and hog shipments to the United States declined sharply after the law took effect. They said the U.S. rules were too stringent and put their livestock at a disadvantage. "The WTO panel decision recognized the integrated nature of the North American supply chain and marked a clear win for our industry," Canadian Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz said in a statement expressing disappointment with the U.S. appeal. "We are confident that the decision will be upheld so trade can move more freely, benefiting producers and processors on both sides of the border," Ritz said. Mexico's economy ministry said in a statement late Friday that it would defend its interest in the appeal process. U.S. consumer group Food & Water Watch welcomed the appeal. "We are heartened that the Obama administration has finally stood up against the meat industry's attack on common-sense rules that let people get vital information about what they are eating," the group's executive director, Wenonah Hauter, said in a statement. The move allows President Barack Obama's administration to delay the politically difficult task of trying to change the law during a U.S. election year in the hope of obtaining a more favorable outcome in the second round of litigation. The U.S. labeling law requires grocers to put labels on cuts of beef, pork, lamb, chicken and ground meat or post signs that list the origin of the meat. Labeling also is required for seafood, fruits, vegetables and ginseng as well as peanuts, pecans and macadamia nuts, but the WTO ruling only covered meat trade. To be listed as U.S. origin, meat must come from animals born, raised and slaughtered in the United States. Meat from livestock raised in Mexico or Canada for slaughter in the United States must be labeled as a product of mixed origin. Changing the law would most affect packing plants that were once big buyers of Canadian animals including those owned by JBS, Tyson Foods, Cargill Inc., Hormel Foods, and Smithfield Foods, Canadian farm industry officials have said. Many U.S. meat-packing plants, especially those near the U.S.-Canada border, either stopped accepting Canadian livestock or bought less due to the increased costs of segregating animals by domestic and foreign origin. "If the country of origin (law) wasn't there, I believe the competition would be quite stiff among the killing plants in the U.S." for Canadian livestock, said Martin Unrau, a Manitoba rancher and president of the Canadian Cattlemen's Association. "Some of the plants won't kill Canadian cattle because they just don't want to be bothered with it."

UPDATE 3-U.S. to appeal WTO ruling against meat labels
