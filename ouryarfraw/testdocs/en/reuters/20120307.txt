Text:China cyber capability puts US forces at risk-report
| Reuters
Wed Mar 7, 2012 11:59pm EST * US supply chain could be penetrated by China - report * Risk of "catastrophic failure" of US networks cited * Congress weighing cybersecurity bills By Jim Wolf WASHINGTON, March 8 (Reuters) - Chinese cyberwarfare would pose a "genuine risk" to the U.S. military in a conflict, for instance over Taiwan or disputes in the South China Sea, according to a report prepared for the U.S. Congress. Operations against computer networks have become fundamental to Beijing's military and national development strategies over the past decade, said the 136-page analysis by Northrop Grumman Corp released on Thursday by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. Chinese commercial firms, bolstered by foreign partners, are giving the military access to cutting-edge research and technology, the analysis said. The Chinese military's close ties to large Chinese telecommunications firms create a path for state-sponsored penetrations of supply networks for electronics used by the U.S. military, government and private industry, it added. That has the potential to cause a "catastrophic failure of systems and networks supporting critical infrastructure for national security or public safety," according to the report. On the military side, "Chinese capabilities in computer network operations have advanced sufficiently to pose genuine risk to U.S. military operations in the event of a conflict," the report said. A senior U.S. defense official took issue with that characterization. "No one should think that Chinese cyber capabilities can seriously impede U.S. military operations, said the official, who asked not to be named pending the Pentagon's formulation of its official response. "We're cognizant of those capabilities, of course, and are working on ways to add to the tools we already have to respond to them if necessary," he said. A spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Beijing in the past has complained about what it called unfair vilification by the 12-member bipartisan commission, which was set up by Congress in 2000 to investigate national-security implications of U.S. trade with China, the world's second-largest economy. Computer network operations, as defined by the report, include attack and defense as well as network "exploitation," for instance for intelligence collection. China is "fully engaged in leveraging all available resources to create a diverse, technically advanced ability to operate in cyberspace," and computer network operations are being broadly applied to assist with long-term national development, the report said. It did not delve into reciprocal U.S. military efforts to gain an edge in cyberspace, which the Pentagon now defines as a potential battle zone like air, sea, space and land. The keyboard-launched tools that China could use in a crisis over Taiwan or in the South China Sea could delay or degrade a potential U.S. military response, partly because of "the vagaries of international law and policy surrounding nation-state responses to apparent network attack," the report said. Northrop Grumman's report is a follow-up to one it did for the commission in 2009. That analysis said Beijing appeared to be conducting "a long-term, sophisticated, computer network exploitation campaign" against the U.S. government and its military contractors. Since then, official U.S. concern has grown over alleged Chinese espionage via computer penetrations. In October, the Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive, a U.S. intelligence arm, said in a declassified report to Congress that "Chinese actors are the world's most active and persistent perpetrators of economic espionage." Commission Chairman Dennis Shea voiced hope in a statement that the new report would help the Congress in its current deliberations over cybersecurity legislation to protect U.S. networks.

Delek US Holdings Reports Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2011 Results
| Reuters
Wed Mar 7, 2012 11:57pm EST  Delek US Holdings Reports Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2011 Results Delek US Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DK), an integrated downstream energy company with assets in the petroleum refining, marketing and retail industries, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2011. For the three months ended December 31, 2011, Delek US reported a net loss from continuing operations of $6.0 million or ($0.10) per basic share, versus a net loss from continuing operations of $70.9 million, or ($1.30) per basic share, in the fourth quarter 2010. Excluding special items, the Company reported an adjusted net loss from continuing operations of $4.5 million, or ($0.07) per basic share, in the fourth quarter 2011. The fourth quarter adjusted net loss from continuing operations excludes the impact of an after-tax $1.5 million impairment on goodwill related to the acquisition of certain retail locations in 2006. For the full-year 2011, Delek US reported record net income from continuing operations of $158.3 million, or $2.78 per diluted share, versus a net loss from continuing operations of $79.9 million, or ($1.47) per basic share, in the full-year 2010. As reported in late January, a pronounced narrowing in crude oil differentials and a decline in regional asphalt prices adversely impacted fourth quarter profitability. Fourth quarter refining margins at the El Dorado refinery and, to a lesser degree, at the Tyler refinery, were impacted by a rapid contraction in crude differentials that began in November and continued through December 2011. The per barrel discount of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) to Louisiana Light Sweet (LLS) crude oil declined from $25/bbl in October to $10/bbl in December. As the WTI-LLS differential narrowed during the final two months of the fourth quarter, the Company's cost of crude increased to levels higher than what the spot WTI-LLS differential would have indicated in those months. Uzi Yemin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Delek US Holdings, remarked: “Delek US had an outstanding year, highlighted by record annual net income from continuing operations. During 2011, we more than doubled our production capacity with the acquisition of a second refinery and significantly increased our portfolio of logistics assets in the Mid-Continent region. Even after funding two acquisitions last year, we managed to reduce our net debt outstanding by $40 million, while continuing to return value to our shareholders through a combination of regular and special cash dividends." Yemin continued: “During the first quarter 2012, Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast refining economics have improved when compared to the prior-year period, providing a solid start to what could be another strong year." “Since last April, our midstream asset purchases have included a 600 mile crude gathering system, five pipeline systems and four product terminals. On a combined basis, these asset purchases further establish our competitive footholds in the Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent markets that surround our Tyler and El Dorado refineries. Looking ahead, we intend to further scale our logistics holdings with strategic acquisitions that complement our existing downstream asset portfolio,” concluded Yemin. As of December 31, 2011, Delek US had $225.9 million in cash and $432.6 million in debt, resulting in a net debt position of $206.7 million. Recently Completed Acquisitions During the fourth quarter 2011 and first quarter 2012, Delek US completed three strategic acquisitions, as follows: Paline Crude Pipeline System Acquisition On December 19, 2011, Delek US acquired all of the membership interests of Paline Pipeline Company, LLC from Ergon Terminaling, Inc. Paline Pipeline Company owns and operates the 10-inch, 185-mile Paline Pipeline System. The Paline Pipeline System is a crude line that runs from Longview to Nederland Texas. Under the prior owner, Paline had been used to transport crude from the Gulf Coast north into Longview. Delek US is in the process of reversing crude flows on Paline under a lease agreement with a major oil company that expires at the end of 2014. Delek US acquired Paline Pipeline Company and all related assets for a purchase price of $50 million, consisting of $25 million cash and a 3-year, $25 million note payable to Ergon. Nettleton Crude Pipeline System Acquisition On January 31, 2012, Delek US, completed the acquisition of the 10-inch, 35-mile Nettleton Pipeline System from Plains Marketing, L.P. for a total consideration of $12.3 million cash. The Nettleton Pipeline is used exclusively to transport crude oil from Longview, Texas to the Tyler refinery. During the year ended December 31, 2011, more than half of the crude oil processed at the Tyler refinery was supplied through the Nettleton Pipeline. Big Sandy Product Terminal & Refined Product Pipeline Acquisition On February 7, 2012, Delek US acquired a light products terminal located in Big Sandy, Texas and a 9-inch, 20-mile refined product pipeline for a total consideration of $11 million cash. The acquisition of this terminal and pipeline system further enhances the Company's marketing capabilities in east Texas. Refining Segment Refining segment contribution margin increased to $30.7 million in the fourth quarter 2011, versus $11.7 million in the fourth quarter 2010. During the fourth quarter 2011, the Tyler refinery generated $41.7 million in contribution margin, while the Company's El Dorado operations reported ($11.0) million in contribution margin. The year-over-year increase in segment contribution margin was attributable to higher throughputs at the Tyler refinery, improved Mid-Continent refined product margins and access to cost-advantaged domestic crude sources. Tyler, Texas Refinery Total throughputs reached a record of 63,722 barrels per day in the fourth quarter 2011, versus 55,318 barrels per day in the prior-year period. Total sales volumes were 63,211 barrels per day in the fourth quarter 2011, compared to 54,405 barrels per day in the fourth quarter 2010. Tyler operated at 94.7 percent of nameplate capacity during the fourth quarter 2011, versus 81.1 percent in the prior-year period, given strong local demand for refined products. Direct operating expense per barrel sold was $4.62 per barrel sold in the fourth quarter 2011, versus $5.51 per barrel sold in the fourth quarter 2010. The year-over-year change was primarily attributable to higher throughputs and lower contractor expenses. Tyler's refining margin, excluding inter-company product marketing fees of $0.53 per barrel, was $12.32 per barrel sold in the fourth quarter 2011, compared to $8.36 per barrel sold for the same quarter last year. The 5-3-2 Gulf Coast crack spread was $20.34 per barrel in the fourth quarter 2011, versus $8.09 per barrel in the fourth quarter 2010. El Dorado, Arkansas Refinery Total throughputs and sales volumes were 82,468 and 75,694 barrels per day, respectively, in the fourth quarter 2011. El Dorado operated at 95.4 percent of nameplate capacity during the fourth quarter 2011. Direct operating expense per barrel sold was $3.65 per barrel sold in the fourth quarter 2011, versus $4.27 per barrel sold in the third quarter 2011. The quarter-over-quarter change was primarily attributable to lower maintenance, chemical and employee expenses. El Dorado's refining margin was $2.07 per barrel sold in the fourth quarter 2011, compared to $14.33 per barrel sold in the third quarter 2011. Retail Segment Retail segment contribution margin increased to $8.5 million in the fourth quarter 2011, versus $8.2 million in the fourth quarter 2010. Fourth quarter results benefited from a combination of improved same-store sales of fuel (gallons), merchandise and fresh food, in addition to an increase in the retail fuel margin, when compared to the prior-year period. Same-store merchandise sales increased 2.0 percent in the fourth quarter 2011, when compared to the prior-year period. Same-store food service sales increased 17.4 percent in the fourth quarter 2011, as the company increased the concentration of fresh food QSR concepts to more than 21 percent of the store base. Merchandise margin declined to 29.2 percent in the fourth quarter 2011, versus 29.8 percent in the prior-year period, due in part to lower gross profit margins in the cigarette category. Same-store retail fuel gallons sold increased 4.3 percent in the fourth quarter 2011, when compared to the prior-year period. The increase in same-store fuel volumes was partially attributable to a more competitively priced fuel offering, when compared to the fourth quarter 2010. The Company's retail fuel margin was 14.6 cents per gallon in the fourth quarter 2011, versus 13.1 cents per gallon in the prior-year period. At the conclusion of the fourth quarter 2011, the retail segment operated 377 locations, versus 412 locations in the prior-year period. Marketing Segment Marketing segment contribution margin declined to $6.0 million in the fourth quarter 2011, versus $6.6 million in the fourth quarter 2010. Total sales volumes increased 6.9% percent to 15,337 barrels per day in the fourth quarter 2011, versus the prior-year period. Total sales volumes increased on a year-over-year basis for the eighth consecutive quarter during the fourth quarter 2011, as demand for gasoline increased by nearly 30 percent during the fourth quarter, when compared to the prior-year period. Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures Delek US reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

For these reasons, management is presenting certain adjustments to GAAP results in order to reflect the ongoing operations of the business. Management believes these measures will help investors better understand and evaluate the Company. Delek US provides the following reconciliation schedule in calculating “adjusted” net income from continuing operations, a non-GAAP measure. The following item(s) are excluded in the calculation of adjusted net income from continuing operations for the three and twelve months ended December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2011.       Year Ended December 31, 2011     Year Ended December 31, 2010   Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2011 Results | Conference Call Information The Company will hold a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and full-year 2011 results on March 8, 2012 at 10:00 a.m. Central Time.

Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Portal 2 Big Winners at the 12th Annual Game Developers Choice Awards
| Reuters
Wed Mar 7, 2012 11:56pm EST  PR Newswire SAN FRANCISCO, March 7, 2012 SAN FRANCISCO, March 7, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Bethesda's epic fantasy adventure, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, took the coveted Game of the Year award, capping off the 12th Annual Game Developers Choice Awards in San Francisco this evening.  Elsewhere in the ceremony, the evening's multiple award winners were Valve Corporation's cunning, wittily written puzzle adventure Portal 2, which received three awards, for Best Game Design, Narrative and Audio. Critically acclaimed action-RPG Bastion from indie developer Supergiant Games, a studio made up of only seven talented people, also took home two Choice Awards, those for Best Debut and Best Downloadable Game. EA DICE pushed the graphical limit last year with the debut of their Frostbite 2 engine used in Battlefield 3, earning them the Best Technology award, while Naughty Dog's beautiful action-adventure title Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception snagged the Best Visual Arts award.  Superbrothers and Capybara Games revitalized the adventure genre and brought it to the age of mobile devices with Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP, which earned the Best Handheld/Mobile Game award. Finally, the Innovation Award went to Johann Sebastian Joust, Die Gute Fabrik's no-graphics, physical party game designed for PlayStation Move motion controllers where players must jostle their opponent's controller while protecting their own.  The tempo of the background music determines the threshold of movement in each controller, making for an intense jousting experience like no other game before. The Game Developers Choice Awards, which honor the very best games of the year, was created for and voted on by developers.  Winners are selected by the Game Developers Choice Awards-specific International Choice Awards Network (ICAN), which is an invitation-only group comprised of 700 leading game creators from all parts of the video game industry. In addition, this year, Warren Spector, Deus Ex game director and producer and Disney Epic Mickey creator, was honored by the Choice Awards Advisory Committee with the Lifetime Achievement Award, for his contributions to the art and science of games with a career spanning nearly 30 years.  The ceremony also presented the Ambassador Award to Ken Doroshow and Paul M. Smith, the legal team which represented the game industry in the landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling that determined content-based restrictions on games are unconstitutional.  This important ruling brought First Amendment rights to those who publish, develop, create and sell video games, helping to protect the future of video games as an open creative medium. Finally, the 2012 Pioneer Award was given to Dave Theurer, Atari pioneer and creator of iconic arcade games such as 1980's Missile Command, seminal vector-based shooter, Tempest and the first commercial video game to use filled 3D polygonal graphics, I, Robot, as well as key early game development tool DeBabelizer.  "This year brought us some wonderfully crafted bigger titles like The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Portal 2 and Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, along with standout independent games like Bastion and Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP," said Meggan Scavio, General Manager of the Game Developers Conference.  "2011 was an incredible year for games, and we can't wait to see what the future holds for these talented developers as the industry continues to grow and shift." The recipients of the 12th Annual Game Developers Choice Awards are: Game of the Year The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (Bethesda Game Studios) Innovation Award Johann Sebastian Joust (Die Gute Fabrik) Best Debut Supergiant Games (Bastion) Best Audio Portal 2 (Valve Corporation) Best Game Design Portal 2 (Valve Corporation) Best Technology Battlefield 3 (DICE) Best Visual Arts Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception (Naughty Dog) Best Narrative Portal 2 (Valve Corporation) Best Downloadable Game Bastion (Supergiant Games) Best Handheld/Mobile Game Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP (Capy Games/Superbrothers) Lifetime Achievement Award Warren Spector Pioneer Award Dave Theurer Ambassador Award Ken Doroshow and Paul M.

Qatar's Doha Bank prices $500 mln bond
| Reuters
DUBAI, March 8 | Wed Mar 7, 2012 11:55pm EST DUBAI, March 8 (Reuters) - Doha Bank priced a $500 million bond on Wednesday through arrangers Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan at the tighter end of guidance, indicating strong demand for the issue. The lender, which is Qatar's fifth largest by market value, priced the five-year bond at a spread of 262.5 basis points over midswaps. The bond carries a coupon of 3.5 percent. Earlier on Wednesday, price guidance was revised to a range of 262.5-275 basis points over midswaps, having tightened significantly from the initial price whisper of 287.5 basis points, due to strong investor demand. Doha Bank is the second Qatari lender to tap global debt markets this year after Qatar National Bank issued a $1 billion bond in February.

Utah lawmakers pass bill to curb sex education in schools

The measure, which cleared Utah's Republican-controlled House and Senate mainly along party-line votes, would also bar instruction on homosexuality or other aspects of human sexuality except for materials that encourage abstinence before marriage. Supporters of the bill, which Utah's Republican governor was widely expected to sign into law, argued that sex education was best left up to parents. "Utah is by far the most restrictive policy out there," said Rebecca Wind, spokeswoman for the nonprofit Guttmacher Institute, which tracks reproductive health policy. "There are no other states that ... don't allow birth control discussion at all, in the way that the Utah legislation does. So it is unique in that respect," she added. With Senate passage on Tuesday on a 19-10 vote, the bill goes to Governor Gary Herbert, who he has not yet taken a public stand on the measure. But Herbert is running for re-election this year and will face conservative Republican Party delegates in a state nominating convention this spring ahead of a possible primary vote in June. At present, Utah school districts can offer sex education classes, with some restrictions, and parents decide whether their teenage children can take the elective class or not. Thirty-seven states require information on abstinence to be included in the sex education curriculum of public schools. Of those states, 26 require abstinence be stressed as the only sure-fire way of preventing pregnancy or infection with sexually transmitted diseases, according to the Guttmacher Institute. The Wisconsin state Assembly is expected to vote next week on a measure to emphasize abstinence in sex education, which cleared the state Senate in November. Guttmacher said some states lack a statewide policy on sex education, leaving choices about reproductive-health curriculum entirely up to the local level. Under Utah's newly passed legislation, public school districts could offer an abstinence-only curriculum or no sex education at all. Democratic lawmakers opposed to the bill argued that not all parents can be expected to adequately inform their children about birth control and reproductive health. They said curtailing sex education in schools would lead to an increase in teenage pregnancies and the spread of sexually-transmitted diseases. But several Republican senators said the public school was the wrong place for individuals outside of a child's family to discuss sexual intercourse, homosexuality or specific sex acts with students. A study published last month in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine found that states with more comprehensive sex education programs had lower teen birth rates. But the research also found those differences appeared to be offset by social and political factors, such as race, income levels, crime rates, abortion laws and religion. The Utah Parents and Teacher Association opposed the bill, but conservative groups, such as the Utah Eagle Forum, supported its passage.

Trayvon Martin was shot dead after he took a break from watching NBA All-Star game television coverage to walk 10 minutes to a convenience store to buy snacks including Skittles candy requested by his 13-year-old brother, Chad, the family's lawyer Ben Crump said. "He was a good kid," Crump said in an interview, adding that the family would issue a call for the Watch captain's arrest at a news conference on Thursday. "On his way home, a Neighborhood Watch loose cannon shot and killed him." Trayvon, who lived in Miami with his mother, had been visiting his father and stepmother in a gated townhome community called The Retreat at Twin Lakes in Sanford, 20 miles north of Orlando. As Trayvon returned to the townhome, Sanford police received a 911 call reporting a suspicious person. Although names are blacked out on the police report, Crump and media reports at the time of the shooting identified the caller as George Zimmerman who is listed in the community's newsletter as the Neighborhood Watch captain. Without waiting for police to arrive, Crump said, Zimmerman confronted Trayvon, who was on the sidewalk near his home. By the time police got there, Trayvon was dead of a single gunshot to the chest. "What do the police find in his pocket? Skittles," Crump said. "A can of Arizona ice tea in his jacket pocket and Skittles in his front pocket for his brother Chad." Zimmerman could not be reached for comment on Wednesday evening at a phone number listed for him on the community's newsletter. Crump said the family was concerned that police might decide to consider the shooting as self defense, and that police have ignored the family's request for a copy of the original 911 call, which they think will shed light on the incidents. "If the 911 protocol across the country held to form here, they told him not to get involved. He disobeyed that order," said Ryan Julison, a spokesman for the family. "He (Zimmerman) didn't have to get out of his car," said Crump, who has prepared a public records lawsuit to file on Thursday if the family doesn't get the 911 tape. "If he never gets out of his car, there is no reason for self-defense. Trayvon only has skittles. He has the gun." Since Trayvon, a high school junior who wanted to be a pilot, was black and Zimmerman is white, Crump said race is "the 600 pound elephant in the room." "Why is this kid suspicious in the first place? I think a stereotype must have been placed on the kid," Crump said.

Berlin berates Athens for bureaucracy stopping investment: paper

Credit: Reuters/Thomas Peter BERLIN | Wed Mar 7, 2012 11:42pm EST BERLIN (Reuters) - Athens' failure to accept Germany's help on reducing bureaucracy and boosting private investment is disappointing, German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler was cited as saying by a newspaper on Thursday. Germany pledged last October to advise Greece on cutting red tape and attracting investment to help its economy get back on its feet and have a fighting chance to cope with its debt. The agreement was struck during Roesler's visit to Greece as head of a 70-strong delegation of German industry representatives seeking business in the country. "The aid has hardly been accepted, a lot has been in vain so far, it is very disillusioning," Roesler told the Saarbruecker Zeitung. The newspaper quoted a ministry progress report on the deal, which read: "The implementation clearly is not a priority on the Greek side." Companies wanting to invest in Greece have met with hurdles such as a multitude of approval procedures and unclear responsibility, according to the ministry. "It is not failing due to a lack of will, the fundamental problem are the structures," Roesler told the paper. Roesler said he was also disappointed that some German companies which had previously done business with Greece had still not been paid. "The Greek side said during my visit that it would soon resolve the old cases," he said. "Unfortunately there has been hardly any progress on this." Germany has a big stake in the debt-stricken Greek economy. Athens has been one of the biggest buyers of German armaments over the past decade and German companies manage some of Greece's largest firms, including Athens International Airport, managed by engineering firm Hochtief. Greece's cash-strapped hospitals owe dozens of millions of euros in arrears to German drugmakers and health equipment providers, such as Bayer. Roesler urged the Greek government to do what was necessary to ensure it could return to growth. Athens needed to create the necessary conditions for growth, by modernizing the administration, opening up its markets and implementing its privatization programme, he said. "Only when these steps have been seriously implemented will the willingness to invest increase," he said. Greece, unable to borrow normally on the bond markets, urgently needs a bailout agreed last month to keep paying its bills while it attempts to make deep structural reforms to its shattered economy, now in the fifth year of deep recession. Euro zone finance ministers are due to decide whether to release the 130 billion euros ($170.57 billion) package during a conference call on Friday but they have already approved the bailout, subject to a private sector creditor agreement slated to go through later on Thursday.

Qatar backs Airbus, Boeing over production flaws
| Reuters
Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al-Baker addresses staff after the arrival of a Qatar Airways Airbus A320 at the Entebbe International Airport, 46 km (29 miles) southwest of Uganda's capital Kampala, November 2, 2011. Credit: Reuters/Edward Echwalu By Tim Hepher BERLIN | Wed Mar 7, 2012 11:35pm EST BERLIN (Reuters) - The head of Qatar Airways, usually one of the aircraft industry's fiercest critics, expressed confidence that Airbus and Boeing would resolve a series of high-profile glitches but warned against further production delays. The endorsements from a top industry figure best known for lambasting manufacturers over delays will come as a relief to both planemakers as they count the cost of recent mishaps. Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said it was normal for new aircraft such as the Airbus (EAD.PA) A380 superjumbo and the Boeing (BA.N) 787 Dreamliner to have teething problems and stressed safety was not an issue. He also seemed satisfied with Boeing's production plans for its new 787 Dreamliner, although many analysts have described the company's plans to boost production to 10 aircraft a month by end-2013 from 2.5 now as optimistic. "The 787 will be a very good airplane. I am confident," Al Baker told Reuters at a trade show on Wednesday. "I cannot discuss the details, but I can tell you that they have a very achievable ramp-up strategy," he said after being briefed on the plans for record wide-body aircraft production. Boeing is grappling with a problem of delamination or the separation of bonded layers in part of the composite structure of its lightweight Dreamliner, while Airbus is wrestling with a series of cracks on components inside the wings of its A380 superjumbo. "I think they will solve the problems with the A380. It is not a big issue...it is an aircraft that is in its infancy," said Al Baker. Analysts say Airbus parent EADS (EAD.PA) may take a charge of some 100 million euros for the cost of repairing the cracks and Airbus CEO Tom Enders has told staff the A380's reputation is at stake and that no costs will be spared to resolve this. EADS will report 2011 earnings on Thursday. Al Baker's remarks at a major travel industry event in Berlin contrast with his comments during the Dubai air show in November when he questioned whether Airbus was "still learning how to build aircraft". He has also recently criticized the Boeing 747-8 for being overweight and burning too much fuel. 777 PLANS Qatar is due to receive its first of 30 787s in June and its first A380 in 2013. With plans to unveil the 787 at the Farnborough air show in July, including lavish seats and entertainment consoles previewed on Wednesday, Al Baker said he would not accept any more delays to the 787, which is about 3 years late. He also warned Airbus against extending a six-month delay for the first variant of its future A350, the European company's answer to the Dreamliner. Qatar now expects to receive the first of 80 planes in mid-2014 instead of late 2013. He repeated criticism of Airbus designs for the largest type of A350 -- the 370-passenger A350-1000 due in 2017, which has also failed to impress other Gulf carriers -- but said the designers had time to come up with improvements. Airbus and Boeing are involved in a tug of war over the direction of the lucrative 'mini-jumbo' market, which is so far dominated by the still fast-selling Boeing 777. Airbus says its plane will replace the 777-300ER but Al Baker rejected this. He said he was "satisfied" with proposals for a new 777 presented in confidential briefings. Boeing has said it will decide what to do in this part of the market later this year. In a boost for Airbus, however, Qatar threw its weight behind the planemaker's latest project by expressing interest in converting up to 20 of its A330 passenger jets into freighters. Al Baker had previously threatened to buy converted Boeing 767 aircraft because of a gap in Airbus's cargo strategy. The plans would involve giving a second life hauling cargo to mid-sized passenger jets. Qatar operates six freighters but is not interested in buying new ones because the economics are not right, so it prefers to convert jetliners, Al Baker said. Some in the $100 billion annual aircraft industry dismiss Al Baker's headline-grabbing criticisms as a negotiating ploy, but he insists he is defending the interests of an airline which is in the throes of dramatic expansion alongside others in the Gulf. "When I need to criticize them (Airbus and Boeing) to wake them up I will and when they are doing things correctly, I should also give them credit," he told a news conference. "I am known to be outspoken but I am also known to be fair. I am not on anyone's payroll and I am looking at everything from the point of view of Qatar Airways." He also played down speculation that Qatar Airways would buy airlines in financial difficulties in Europe and said it had shelved plans to buy the new CSeries being developed by Canada's Bombardier (BBDb.TO), but had "not written the CSeries off".

Australian man pleads guilty over collar-bomb hoax

Credit: Reuters/U.S. Department of Justice/Handout SYDNEY | Wed Mar 7, 2012 11:32pm EST SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian man arrested in the United States and accused of clamping a fake bomb around the neck of a Sydney teenager pleaded guilty to the charges on Thursday, in a surprise conclusion to a case that has dominated Australian media. The case sparked an international man-hunt and led to a tense 10 hours for teenager Madeleine Pulver after a man broke into her family's luxury Sydney home last August and strapped what he said was a bomb around her neck, leaving a note demanding money. The collar bomb was later found to be fake. Police in the United States arrested Paul Douglas Peters, 50, in a suburb of Louisville, Kentucky, about two weeks after the incident, after he was tracked down through email accounts. At a court hearing in Sydney, lawyers for Peters said he pleaded guilty to the charge of aggravated break and enter, committing serious indictable offence, bringing relief to Pulver and her family. "We are incredibly pleased with today's outcome. It is great comfort knowing Maddie won't have to endure the stress and anxiety of reliving the events of that terrible night," Madeleine's father, Bill Pulver, told reporters. "Today's guilty plea brings closure to a crime that remains a mystery and as random to us in our mind as it did back on August 3." Peters appeared in Sydney's Central Local Court via a video link, and he made no comment. He remains in a Sydney jail and will return to court on March 16 for sentencing. However, his lawyer, Kathy Crittenden, told reporters outside the court that Peters was "profoundly sorry".
