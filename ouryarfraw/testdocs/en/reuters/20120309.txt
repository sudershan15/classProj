Fri Mar 9, 2012 11:43pm EST  Thank You from Japan Preparing for the first anniversary of the historic natural disaster that hit the northeastern Japan on March 11, 2011, Japan National Tourism Organization (JNTO), along with Japan Tourism Agency (JTA), expresses special appreciation for all the support from the American people, which brought 566,000 visitors from the US to Japan within less than one year. Times Square turned pink! The double-decker buses carrying pink billboard and a flock of people in beautiful silk kimono strolling on Broadway. On the first anniversary of the natural disaster, the president of JNTO Ryoichi Matsuyama also expresses a sincere gratitude, appealing that “Japan is ready to welcome another spring sun” for visitors to enjoy the beautiful cherry blossom all over the country. Coinciding with the centennial of the cherry trees gifted from Japan to Washington DC, JNTO and JTA welcome US visitors to Japan and re-emphasize Japan’s tourism attraction with a special version of the tourism campaign logo. Experience Japan in New York City A few Japanese organizations installed a series of Japan events, Japan Week (http://japanweek.us/), in New York City from March 1 to 11. Times Square Times Square turned pink! Japan has set off the special celebration month on March 1 with the unprecedented view of Times Square with pink on digital screens, the double-decker buses carrying pink billboard and a flock of people in beautiful silk kimono strolling on Broadway. Grand Central Terminal The time-honored Vanderbilt Hall became a multi-dimensional pavilion of Japanese culture. Responding to huge popularity of Japanese cuisine, the Organization to Promote Japanese Restaurant Abroad (JRO) and JNTO brought culinary and tourism together for the first time to a public event. Started on March 1 throughout the first weekend of March, the Hall drew even more crowds than the Terminals main hall a few times! Tourists, commuters, office workers and Japan fans flocked to the event for the first-hand experience of Japan. Statistics Shows Amazing Recovery in Tourism According to an Oxford Economics report, progress against a major decrease in Japan’s tourism industry “was tracked and found to be positive – in line with the best-case scenario.” This is a remarkably rapid recovery in less than one year after the disaster, and a global brand marketing consultancy Future Brand, Japan is described as “the hero in tourism” for managing all tourism elements for goodwill in the face of crisis. JNTO’s statistics show the recovery in the US market tops among the western markets with 51,706 visitors in January 2012, which reaches up almost to the same level from the same month from last year after almost 60% decrease in April 2011.

Credit: Reuters/Ahmd Nadeem By Mirwais Harooni KABUL | Fri Mar 9, 2012 11:40pm EST KABUL (Reuters) - The United States and Afghanistan signed an agreement on Friday on the transfer of a major U.S.-run detention centre to Afghan authorities, improving the prospects of a deal allowing long-term American involvement in the country. The Strategic Partnership Agreement, which Washington and Kabul have been discussing for over a year, will be the framework for U.S. involvement in Afghanistan beyond 2014, when the last foreign combat troops are due to leave Afghanistan. Afghan Defense Minister Gen. Abdul Rahim Wardak, who signed the deal to hand over the prison at Bagram airbase, said an Afghan general would soon be appointed to take charge of it. The transfer would be completed in about six months. "The signing of this memorandum is an important step forward in our Strategic Partnership negotiations," said General John Allen, commander of the United States forces in Afghanistan, at the ceremony. "It is yet another example of the progress of transition, and our efforts to ensure that Afghanistan can never again be a safe haven for terrorists." In what appeared to be a compromise, the agreement states that the United States has veto power over which detainees can be released from Bagram, which is believed to hold many suspected Taliban fighters. Ties between Washington and Kabul have been heavily strained for weeks after copies of the Koran, the Muslim holy book, were burned at Bagram by U.S. soldiers in what NATO called a tragic blunder. Widespread protests erupted in which 30 people were killed. Afghan forces turned their weapons on U.S. soldiers, killing six. PRECONDITIONS Afghanistan wants a timeline to take over detention centers and for the United States and NATO to agree to stop carrying out night raids on Afghan homes as preconditions for signing an agreement with Washington. In January, an Afghan government commission investigating abuse accusations at Bagram said inmates had reported being tortured and held without evidence. However, the commission said it had found no evidence of torture on the detainees' bodies. The findings came just days after President Hamid Karzai called for the facility to be handed over to Afghan control. The decision to transfer prisoners appeared to have lifted the spirits of some Afghans, who say Western soldiers often fail to grasp their country's religious and cultural sensitivities. "The Afghan army and police are capable of taking control of Afghan prisoners who are in foreign detention," said Kabul resident Feda Mohammad, 58. "This is something that Afghanistan needs to take charge of not America or any other foreign country." A senior Afghan official said earlier this week that the transfer of the Bagram detention centre - the biggest U.S.-run prison in Afghanistan - would be a first step to handing over other facilities. The Obama administration has been hoping it can conclude a partnership agreement before a meeting of NATO leaders in Chicago in May. While the document is unlikely to specify details, it is expected to contain an agreement in principle to some sort of long-term U.S. military presence in Afghanistan. Failure to broker a deal might hurt U.S.-Afghan relations and increase the chances of prolonged turmoil in Afghanistan. Afghan security forces still rely heavily on Western firepower and intelligence in the fight against the Taliban.

Rasool is scheduled to leave for Qatar in under ten days, Foreign Ministry spokesman Janan Mosazai told Reuters. The Afghan Taliban announced in January it would open a political office in Qatar, suggesting the group may be willing to engage in negotiations that would be likely to give it Afghan government positions or official control over much of its historical southern heartland.

House GOP look to reshape birth control debate

Credit: Reuters/Kevin Lamarque By Donna Smith and Thomas Ferraro WASHINGTON | Fri Mar 9, 2012 11:37pm EST WASHINGTON (Reuters) - House Republican leaders are looking for a way to reshape the debate over the administration's new rule on birth-control insurance coverage before moving ahead with a bid to nullify the requirement. Representative Jeff Fortenberry, who has introduced legislation on the issue, acknowledged hesitation by some fellow Republicans to take on the incendiary issue. But he said a delay could give Republicans time to recast the issue as a question of religious freedom rather than women's rights. "We'll keep trying to appropriately frame the debate about this core American principle," Fortenberry said. Representative Pete Sessions, who heads the House Republican campaign committee, said party leaders are not backing off. "We're not hesitant to do anything," Sessions said. "The successful rain dance has a lot to do with timing." House Republicans have taken a cautious approach after the Senate, mostly on party lines, rejected a measure that would have allowed employers with moral objections to opt out of birth control coverage and other services. The administration's plan would require employers, including charities and other religious institutions, to provide contraception coverage at no extra charge. Senator Roy Blunt, who offered the Senate measure, said Democrats' framing of the issue as a women's rights question proved to be a problem. "We're not going to win that debate on birth control," said Blunt. But the debate over religious liberty is not going to go away." The issue has made some Republicans cautious in an election year, when most voters are concerned about U.S. economic growth and job creation, said one aide. A spokeswoman for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said Republican leaders were still discussing with members how best to move forward. Fortenberry said it is unclear whether his legislation will be the bill that moves forward in the House. But he believes he has the votes to ensure passage. FIRST OBAMA, THEN REPUBLICANS Obama faced an uproar from religious groups over the administration's birth control requirement. But he moved quickly to quell it by altering the rule so employers with religious affiliations would not be required to offer free birth control to workers. Insurers would instead bear the onus to provide coverage. Republicans said the compromise did not go far enough and announced plans to move forward with measures that would override the ruling. Incendiary comments by conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh, who called Georgetown University law student Sandra Fluke "a slut and prostitute" for speaking out in support of the Obama policy, helped Democrats reframe the issue to their political advantage, analysts said. Limbaugh, who has lost advertisers who found his comments objectionable, has since apologized. It looked like an attack on women and women are the majority of the electorate," said Jennifer Lawless of the Women and Politics Institute at American University. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey last week of 1,500 adults showed nearly two-thirds of Americans favor Obama's policy, including clear majorities of Catholics and evangelicals. A number of religious groups have filed lawsuits challenging the new rule. Republican strategist Ron Bonjean, a former congressional aide, said House Speaker John Boehner has good reason to schedule a vote on a measure to overturn the rule. While jobs and the economy are the number one issue, this is one of those niche issues that can really make a difference in the election among Catholic voters," he said. "They respond well to the issue of religious freedoms," he added. "If Catholic congregations hear that Republicans are on their side, that can only help them in November."

Government to cut Texas women's health funds in abortion dispute

Credit: Reuters/Kevin Lamarque AUSTIN, Texas | Fri Mar 9, 2012 11:36pm EST AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - The federal government will withdraw funding for a Texas program providing more than 100,000 poor women with birth control and other health services because Planned Parenthood clinics are not allowed to participate, a U.S. Health and Human Services spokeswoman said on Friday. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius announced the decision in Houston on Friday, prompting a furious response from Texas Governor Rick Perry, who called it an "egregious federal overreach." At the heart of the dispute between the administration of President Barack Obama and Texas is the divisive issue of abortion. The Texas legislature last year voted to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood because the network of women's health clinics performs abortions. The federal government says that this violates rules of Medicaid, the health program for the poor. Some 130,000 low-income Texas women who get free exams and contraceptives through Medicaid could lose those benefits as a result of the dispute. The program provides free birth control and annual exams to women of reproductive age who do not qualify for the regular Medicaid program for the poor. The federal government pays 90 percent of the cost and Texas puts up about $4 million a year. Wisconsin, North Carolina, Tennessee and Indiana all have joined Texas trying to block Planned Parenthood from receiving taxpayer money in the last year. Several other states, including Ohio, Oklahoma and New Hampshire, are considering similar moves. While public funds do not pay for abortions, critics of Planned Parenthood argue that hiring the organization to provide family planning to poor women helps the organization stay afloat and thus indirectly supports abortion services. The Texas funding cut prompted Planned Parenthood to shut down 11 clinics in the state. Perry said the decision by the Obama administration was "politically motivated," and said it was an affront that Sebelius had not informed the state of Texas before announcing the move to the press. A spokeswoman for Sebelius had no comment beyond confirming the decision to cut off funding to Texas. The abortion fight is the latest of a string of disputes between Obama's Democratic administration and the Republican-dominated Texas state government. The two sparred last year over disaster aid for Texas after devastating wildfires and environmental regulations Texas opposes.

Top seed Azarenka edges through in Indian Wells

Victoria Azarenka of Belarus celebrates winning a point in the third set tie breaker against Mona Barthel of Germany during their match at the Indian Wells WTA tennis tournament in Indian Wells, California, March 9, 2012. Credit: Reuters/Danny Moloshok By Mark Lamport-Stokes INDIAN WELLS, California | Fri Mar 9, 2012 11:28pm EST INDIAN WELLS, California (Reuters) - World number one Victoria Azarenka improved her unbeaten record to 18-0 this year after battling past Germany's Mona Barthel 6-4 6-7 7-6 in the second round of the Indian Wells WTA tournament on Friday. Top seed Azarenka squandered a 5-1 lead in the second set and then came from 1-4 and 3-5 down in the third before sealing a tight victory 8-6 in the tiebreak when her opponent hit a backhand long. The Belarusian, who clinched her first grand slam crown at the Australian Open in January, double-faulted 12 times in an error-strewn encounter and celebrated in subdued fashion when the match ended after three hours on the stadium court. "It was survival, but it's a good feeling also to come through after a match like this with a win," a relieved Azarenka told reporters. "I could have been already beating myself up somewhere in my house after losing. "But I'm here and I got through, and that's a good sign ... to win when you're not playing your best, it's more joyful. "I won this match mentally more than physically or tactically or whatever. That was really what brought me a win today, my fighting spirit, till the last moment." Azarenka will next meet 25th-seeded Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova, who advanced after Swiss Timea Bacsinszky retired hurt with a wrist injury when trailing 3-6 0-2. GUTSY DISPLAY Barthel, who had lost to the Belarusian in their two previous meetings this year, was delighted with her gutsy display at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden. "I stayed really calm ... but she's ranked No. 1 and she really kept fighting for every point," said the 37th-ranked German, who won her first WTA title in Hobart in January. "She deserved to win in the end but of course it was really close." Asked whether she had changed her strategy after trailing 1-5 in the second set, Barthel replied: "I was just trying to continue to play like that because I knew it was close. "I lost some games where I had some game points, so I just was trying to fight, just trying to continue. I have nothing to lose against the world No. 1 so I can just play my game. I'm happy I could turn the second set around." Barthel, who twice served for the match in the third set before Azarenka took control, frequently troubled the world number one with her rasping groundstrokes and clever changes of pace. "I think she played unbelievable tennis, the best of our previous matches," Azarenka said of the 21-year-old. "I have to give her a lot of credit for making me also not play well. "She really stepped it up and showed some incredible strokes and serves so all the credit to her. Mona was really motivated to beat me today."

Chinese police shoot dead 4 in raid in Xinjiang: report

The pre-dawn raid on a farmhouse took place on Thursday after a man was injured while making a bomb at home, which raised suspicions, the U.S.-based broadcaster quoted local police as saying. China has blamed violence in Xinjiang on Islamic separatists who want to establish an independent state called East Turkestan. Some Chinese officials have also blamed attacks on Muslim militants trained in Pakistan. Exiled Uighur groups and human rights activists say China overstates the threat posed by militants in Xinjiang, which sits astride south and central Asia. Twenty-one people were detained by police in Thursday's raid, during which one of the suspects chopped off a policeman's hand with an axe, Radio Free Asia said. Last month, the government said attackers wielding knives killed 13 people in Xinjiang before police killed seven of them. Uighurs account for just over 40 percent of the Xinjiang region's 21 million people. But they are the majority in Kashgar and other parts of the region's south and many resent government controls on their culture and religion. In July 2009, Uighurs rioted against Han Chinese residents in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang. At least 197 people were killed, most of them Han, according to official estimates. In January, authorities said that seven people killed by police in Xinjiang had been trying to leave the country to wage "holy war". The government sees Xinjiang as a bulwark facing the predominantly Muslim countries of central Asia. The region, with a sixth of the country's land mass, is also rich in natural resources, including oil, coal and gas.

Chindex International, Inc. Reports Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year of 2011
| Reuters
Fri Mar 9, 2012 11:00pm EST  PR Newswire BETHESDA, Md., March 9, 2012 BETHESDA, Md., March 9, 2012 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Chindex International, Inc. (NASDAQ: CHDX), an American health care company providing health care services in China through the operations of United Family Healthcare, a network of private primary care hospitals and affiliated ambulatory clinics, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2011 ended December 31, 2011. Fourth Quarter 2011 Financial Highlights Roberta Lipson, President and CEO of Chindex, commented, "We had a strong fourth quarter of 2011, with revenue growing 22% to $31.9 million year over year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 44% in the quarter to $6.2 million, representing a 19% adjusted EBITDA margin.  For the full year of 2011, we are pleased to deliver 20% year over year growth during our first year as a pure play healthcare services company. This has been a year focused on expansion through strengthening traffic at our existing facilities and building out new facilities. Our revenue performance has begun to reflect contribution from our efforts, with growth rates rising in the second half of 2011 to the mid-teens and low-twenties." "Looking forward to 2012, Chindex will remain dedicated to bringing our unique experience of premium, private healthcare to more consumers, across more service offerings and in more locations throughout China. We expect revenue growth to further accelerate to the mid-twenties, driven by strong demand in existing facilities as well as growing contribution from new facility openings, and adjusted EBITDA margin to remain stable in the mid-teens. Again, we stress that we believe our adjusted EBITDA performance is the best metric for judging our operational performance throughout this period of intensive hospital network expansion." "Overall, the UFH network is well-positioned as a leading provider of premium healthcare services in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangzhou. These affluent metropolitan cities with rapid economic development, growing international populations and widening target patient bases offer significant room for expansion. Moreover, we believe our plans are well-timed with increasingly favorable policies and growing market demand to achieve increasing top-line growth and steady profitability." "We would like to also help investors better understand contributions from our Chindex Medical Limited joint venture. Late in the fourth quarter, CML shipped a daVinci surgical robot system which could not be recognized as revenue in 2011 under CML's accounting policy for equipment sales. The associated revenue and gross margin will not be recognized until 2012 when the system is installed. As a result, contribution from CML during the fourth quarter was immaterial. Nevertheless, we are pleased with CML's first year of operations, which contributed significantly to our bottom line. In the coming year, we believe CML's progress in obtaining SFDA approval and initiating marketing activities for new imaging products for sale in the China market and expansion of its manufacturing base through strategic capital investments in its dental business will continue to drive growth. For the near term, however, we expect our contribution from CML to remain steady but moderate in growth." Fourth Quarter 2011 Financial Results Fourth quarter 2011 revenue from healthcare services increased 22% to $31.9 million from $26.1 million in the prior year period, reflecting continued growth of inpatient and outpatient volume across the United Family Healthcare network as well as nascent contributions from the phased opening of the expansion of the Company's flagship hospital in Beijing. Outpatient services contributed 58% of revenue and inpatient services contributed 42% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to 59% and 41%, respectively, in the prior year period. By service line, for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2011, surgical services contributed 19%, OB/GYN contributed 16%, pediatrics contributed 9%, ancillary services contributed 33% and other services contributed 23% of revenue. Operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2011 increased 22% to $29.8 million from $24.4 million in the prior year period primarily reflecting the Company's ongoing expansion efforts. Salaries, wages and benefits in the fourth quarter of 2011 increased 23% to $17.3 million from $14.1 million in the prior year period reflecting a growth in headcount to drive revenue growth and support development activities. Development, pre- and post-opening and start up expenses for the Beijing United expansion, Shanghai Pudong expansion, Tianjin United Family ramp up and Beijing United Family Rehabilitation Hospital were $2.6 million this quarter, compared to $675,000 for the prior year period. Operating expenses also included certain non-cash expenses including $630,000 of stock compensation expense compared to $1.0 million for the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2011 increased to approximately $6.2 million, representing a 19% adjusted EBITDA margin, compared to $4.3 million in the prior year period driven by consistent profitability of existing facilities. Income from operations was $2.1 million compared to $2.8 million in the prior year period reflecting the deconsolidation of the medical products division. The Company recorded a $835,000 provision for taxes in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to a provision for taxes of $979,000 in the prior year period. Net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2011 was $1.2 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, compared to $1.7 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, in the prior year period. For the fourth quarter of 2011, weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 17.2 million. Full year 2011 Financial Results During the full year ended December 31, 2011, revenue from healthcare services increased 20% to $114.4 million from $95.4 million in the prior year period, reflecting growing inpatient and outpatient volume across the United Family Healthcare network. Outpatient services contributed 59% of revenue and inpatient services contributed 41% of revenue for the full year of 2011, compared to 60% and 40%, respectively, in the year ago period. By service line, surgical services contributed 18%, OB/GYN contributed 15%, pediatrics contributed 8%, ancillary services contributed 33% and other services contributed 26% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011. Operating expenses for the full year 2011 increased 25% to $108.7 million from $87.1 million in the prior year period primarily due to increased staffing, office and administrative supplies associated with the Company's ongoing development and expansion plans. Development, pre-opening and start up expenses, including post-opening expenses, rose to $7.8 million from $2.1 million in the prior year period primarily as a result of expenses related to the Company's Beijing, Pudong and Tianjin projects. Operating expenses also included certain non-cash expenses including $3.1 million of non-cash stock compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $19.0 million compared to $14.1 million in the prior year period. Income from operations was $5.7 million compared to income from operations of $10.7 million in the prior year period reflecting the deconsolidation of the medical products division. Provision for taxes was $3.7 million compared to $4.3 million in the prior year period. Net income was $3.2 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to net income of $6.3 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, in the prior year period. For the full year ended December 31, 2011, weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 17.4 million. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had $60.3 million in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and investments. Non-GAAP Measures The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA to better illustrate ongoing operational results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income (loss) before interest expense, interest and other income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and also excludes development, pre-opening and start-up expenses related to new and pending hospitals and clinics, equity in earnings (loss) income of unconsolidated affiliate, non-recurring charges for Chindex Medical Limited (CML) joint venture formation and effect of change in corporate cost allocations. The Company anticipates recurring development, pre-opening and start-up expense and notes that such expense is a basic element of the long term growth plan. Management believes that providing an Adjusted EBITDA analysis to investors is a helpful metric to better illustrate the Company's operations, including development plans, and changes in presentation from historical periods. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA for business planning and other purposes. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, and therefore Chindex's Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities and other measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant and necessary components to the operations of the Company's business, and, therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should only be used as a supplemental measure of operating performance. Chindex Medical Limited The Chindex Medical Limited joint venture (CML) between FosunPharma and Chindex International began operations on January 1, 2011. The strategic venture merged the former Medical Products division of Chindex International and select medical device companies of FosunPharma. FosunPharma owns 51% and Chindex owns 49% of the CML joint venture. Chindex recognizes its 49% interest in CML's net income using the equity method of accounting. For the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company recognized immaterial income from its equity interest reflecting the deferral of revenue related to CML's sale of a daVinci surgical robot system. For the full year ended December 31, 2011, the Company recognized $1.1 million for its equity interest in CML. In recognizing its 49% interest in the net income of CML for these periods, Chindex also included additional expenses for amortization of certain fair value adjustments made in connection with the formation of the joint venture.
