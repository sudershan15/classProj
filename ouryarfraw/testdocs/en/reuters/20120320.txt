TOULOUSE, March 21 | Tue Mar 20, 2012 11:59pm EDT TOULOUSE, March 21 (Reuters) - Two French police officers were injured in a shoot-out during a raid on a house in Toulouse on Wednesday to arrest suspects in the killings of three children and a rabbi at a Jewish school in southwest France this week, a police source said. The source said the raid began at 3.00 am local time (0200 GMT) and was ongoing, but did not provide further details. French news channel BFM TV said the suspects were linked to an Islamist group which it identified as Forsane Alizza but it was not immediately possible to confirm this.

Beats Audio in talks to acquire MOG music service
| Reuters
By Tom Cheredar at VentureBeat Tue Mar 20, 2012 11:51pm EDT Beats Audio, the headphone company affiliated with legendary rapper Dr. Dre, is rumored to be in discussions to purchase music startup MOG, according to multiple reports. MOG is a subscription-based streaming music service that’s similar to Rdio, Rhapsody, and Spotify. MOG offers a free ad-supported version of the service, an ad-free $4.99 per month web subscription, and an ad-free $9.99 per month web/mobile device subscription. Despite massive growth from integration with Facebook’s Open Graph, MOG still struggles to compete against the large number of competitors. MOG’s chief executive denied rumors that his company was looking for a potential buyer, as VentureBeat first reported back in February. The deal between MOG and Beats hasn’t been finalized, according to an AllThingsD report. The acquisition would make sense for Beats, which counts mobile phone maker HTC as its majority owner. HTC already has Beats’ speakers inside its mobile devices. Should the deal go through, a Beats Audio-owned MOG service could also be paired with HTC devices. Update: BusinessInsider’s Matt Rosoff just pointed out that he first reported the rumor in a report yesterday.

UPDATE 1-Japan's Soma resumes full ops at quake-hit coal units
| Reuters
Tue Mar 20, 2012 11:51pm EDT * Two 1,000-MW units resume full ops with coal as fuel * No maintenance shutdowns for 2 units this year (Adds details) TOKYO, March 21 (Reuters) - Japan's Soma Kyodo Power Co Ltd said its two coal-fired units were as of Tuesday running at their full-capacity earlier than expected and for the first time since they were damaged in an earthquake in March last year. The company is a 50-50 joint venture between Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco) and Tohoku Electric Power Co. The units' output will help ease a looming power shortage in Japan, where only two of 54 nuclear reactors are still operating amid safety concerns after the March disaster triggered a radiation crisis at Tepco's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. The units, each with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts, are at the utility's Shinchi plant in Fukushima, northern Japan, and use thermal coal. They are not scheduled to be shut down for planned maintenance this year, a company official said. In February, the company said it expects the two units to become fully operational by the summer. The two units resumed partial operations in December for the first time since the quake, using mainly fuel oil as feedstock. Soma supplies 50 percent of the plant's output to its parent firms.

STOCKS NEWS ASEAN-Sakari margins poised to grow - CIMB
| Reuters
Tue Mar 20, 2012 11:46pm EDT CIMB Research said Singapore-listed coal miner Sakari Resources Ltd is in the early stages of making its business model more efficient and will see higher profit margins as it increases production at its Northern Leases mines. The broker raised its share price target for Sakari to S$ 2.73 from S$2.71 and kept its outperform rating. Recent changes to Indonesia's mining rules regarding foreign investment will not affect Sakari and its mines are structured as domestically owned investments, CIMB said. By 0315 GMT, shares of Sakari were 0.8 percent lower at S$2.41 but have gained 31 percent so far this year.  1117 (0317 GMT) Reporting by Charmian Kok in Singapore Reuters messaging rm://charmian.kok.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net  ************************************************************ 10:28 STOCKS NEWS ASEAN-DBS starts Sheng Siong at hold DBS Group Research has initiated coverage of Singapore supermarket operator Sheng Siong Group Ltd with a hold rating and a share price target of S$0.49.

DBS said Sheng Siong is a niche player in a defensive sector, with a 90 percent dividend payout ratio, free cashflow of 3 to 4 Singapore cents per share going forward and higher dividend yields than its peers. Its compound annual growth rate for core earnings in the 2011-2013 fiscal years is projected at 20 percent, driven by store expansions and operating efficiencies from a new warehouse, DBS said.

Phone call reveals final moments of slain Florida teen: lawyer

An unidentified driver protests the death of Trayvon Martin outside Sanford Police Headquarters in Sanford, Florida March 20, 2012. Credit: Reuters/David Manning By Barbara Liston ORLANDO, Florida | Tue Mar 20, 2012 11:42pm EDT ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) - The case of an unarmed black teenager shot dead by a white neighborhood watch captain who police have failed to arrest will go before a grand jury, Florida prosecutors said on Tuesday. State prosecutor Norm Wolfinger made the announcement as the victim's family lawyer said 17-year-old Trayvon Martin was on his cellphone with a girlfriend, giving her a chilling, minute-by-minute account of what was happening in the moments before he died. Police in the central Florida town of Sanford where Martin was gunned down have not arrested neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman. They did not return phone calls on Tuesday seeking comment on the case, which has sparked widespread public outrage since the release of 911 emergency tapes last week. Family lawyer Ben Crump said the girlfriend's testimony shed new light on the killing and would show that Zimmerman targeted Martin because he was black. "This confirms that Trayvon Martin was killed only because he was a young black man who was profiled by Zimmerman," Crump told Reuters. Phone records show the girl, who Crump would not identify because she is a minor, had been talking to Martin off-and-on all day on February 26, and can provide convincing evidence that he was behaving normally, Crump said. "Her call connects the dots to completely destroy what Zimmerman said (to the police) about ‘this kid was up to no good,'" Crump said. "This kid was simply trying to walk home and get out of the rain while he talked to his little friend. And that's all he was doing. He was completely innocent." Martin was walking home from a convenience store, where he went to buy snacks shortly before the NBA All-Star basketball game, when Zimmerman spotted him. Zimmerman called Sanford Police to report a suspicious person in the neighborhood and then, while armed with a handgun, followed Martin despite the police dispatcher telling him not to. The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and the FBI said on Monday that they had opened an investigation into the shooting. Police have declined to arrest the 28-year-old Zimmerman and turned the case over to prosecutors, citing Florida's "Stand Your Ground" law, enacted in 2005 and now in effect in about 20 other states. The law provides a shooter with wide latitude to claim a killing was in self-defense. Crump said Martin got off the phone with the girl for a few minutes because he was running to get out of the rain. "IN COLD BLOOD" The two reconnected by cellphone for the last time at 7:12 p.m. for four minutes. Police say they arrived at the scene at 7:17 to find Martin dead from a gunshot, Crump said. The girl told Crump that Martin told her he was being followed and that she had encouraged him to run. "She knew details about what went on because he was telling her," Crump said. He said the girl heard the initial confrontation between Martin and Zimmerman. "Trayvon said, 'Why you following me, man?'" and Zimmerman said, 'What are you doing here?'" Crump said. He said the girl could tell by Martin's voice that he was then pushed. She thinks Martin's cellphone headset came off and then the call was disconnected, Crump said. He said that when she called back, the girl did not get an answer and knew nothing else until she heard of Martin's killing on the news. The girl was so traumatized after learning what happened that she was unable to attend Martin's wake and had to be hospitalized, Crump said. Crump said the investigation of Martin's killing is unfolding in typical fashion for a case involving a black victim in America, with police and prosecutors prolonging an investigation before passing the buck to a grand jury. He also criticized police for performing a background check on Martin and testing him for drugs and alcohol, procedures that he said had not been applied with Zimmerman. "It's almost like a playbook," Crump said. Crump said Martin's parents believed nothing would have been done about their son's killing had they not brought in their own lawyer to put the spotlight on the case. "Arrest George Zimmerman for the killing of Trayvon Martin in cold blood today," Crump said. "It's about equal justice." Highlighting interest in the case, more than 628,000 people have signed a petition on Change.org, a social action website, calling for Zimmerman's arrest. Wolfinger, the state attorney, called for patience as he announced that a grand jury would be convened on April 10 to investigate the killing. In what were thought to be her first public comments on the case on Tuesday, state Attorney General Pam Bondi said investigators from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement would help ensure a "complete and thorough review" of all facts surrounding Martin's death. "No stone will be left unturned in this investigation," Bondi said. (This version of the story corrects the name of the neighborhood watch captain in the 3rd paragraph) (Editing By Tom Brown and Eric Walsh)   One factual quibble: the article states “The case of an unarmed black teenager shot dead by a white neighborhood watch captain”. I’m reading other sources (NPR, not just Fox) that say that Zimmerman is Latino. Reuters should amend or clarify.

Zuckerberg a no-show at pre-IPO analyst meeting
| Reuters
By Jennifer Van Grove at VentureBeat Tue Mar 20, 2012 11:41pm EDT Mark Zuckerberg may have completed the ultimate power play in nabbing a majority of Facebook’s voting rights, but the youthful chief executive would apparently prefer to take a back seat as his social networking company courts analysts and investors on the road to a public offering. Zuckberg skipped a three-hour meeting with analysts and bankers at Facebook’s headquarters on Monday and plans to be mostly hands-off in the selling process, sources told the Wall Street Journal. Facebook COO and company front-woman Sheryl Sandberg and CFO David Ebersman led the meeting. “In response to a question about his absence … Ebersman said Mr. Zuckerberg preferred to focus his time on developing the service rather than play a role with such analysts,” according to the Journal. Altimeter Group founder and partner Charlene Li thinks Zuckerberg’s absence from the meeting was a move designed to set expectations early on. Traditional analysts may be put off by the no-show, she told VentureBeat, but they will get over the snub, “as long as Zuck is available to discuss the overall vision and direction of the firm at appropriate points.” Facebook filed to become a public company on February 1, 2012. The social network, which made $3.7 billion in 2011, will raise at least $5 billion in a May offering with a valuation between $75 and $100 billion. The company is also said to be paying its IPO underwriters a below-average 1.1 percent fee. Since its initial filing, Facebook has amended its prospectus, secured several billion dollars in additional credit, reconfigured its advertising products to reduce its mobile risk, and is now busy fighting off a patent suit from one-time Valley pal Yahoo. And while Zuckerberg snubbed analysts, the CEO may still play some part in the larger roadshow when the company travels and presents to fund managers and potential buyers, but executives are undecided on his exact role, a source told the Journal. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment.

UPDATE 1-Hyundai Motor CEO says new Sonata planned in 2014
| Reuters
Tue Mar 20, 2012 11:33pm EDT * First Sonata revamp in over four years * New Genesis sedan planned in late 2013 -CEO * Hyundai shares down 0.9 pct vs 0.6 pct fall in KOSPI SEOUL, March 21 (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor plans to launch a revamped version of its flagship Sonata sedan in 2014, its first upgrade in more than four years, its chief executive said on Wednesday, as the company grapples with increasing foreign competition in its home market. Hyundai, the world's fifth-largest auto group along with its affiliate Kia Motors, has only one new model planned for a global launch this year. It started taking pre-orders on Wednesday for the new Santa Fe sports utility vehicle, which will be unveiled in April. The latest version of the Sonata was launched in September 2009 in South Korea and early 2010 in the United States. Sonata, which competes with Toyota Motor Corp's Camry, is Hyundai's top-selling model in the United States and helped the South Korean automaker achieve record sales and market share there last year. It was Hyundai's third-best selling model in South Korea last year. Hyundai's domestic car sales are increasingly coming under pressure following free trade deals with Europe and the United States that have boosted international automakers' access to South Korea's formerly sheltered market. Sales of imported cars topped 10 percent of the market for the first time in January this year, according to industry data. Toyota has started to sell U.S.-made Camry sedans in South Korea and is considering importing cars from Europe as it seeks to boost local sales by 160 percent to 13,000 vehicles this year, and Lexus sales by 90 percent to 8,000. Hyundai chief executive Kim Choong-ho also told Reuters on the sidelines of an industry meeting that the revamped version of the large-sized Genesis would be introduced in late 2013. Shares in Hyundai fell 0.9 percent by 0310 GMT, versus a 0.6 percent rise in the broader market.
