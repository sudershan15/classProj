The back page of the New York Post had the catchphrase written on a tombstone to mark the end of the free-wheeling offense Lin ran during an inspired streak under former coach Mike D'Antoni that made the Asian-American a global sensation. Reports of his passing into oblivion, however, were greatly exaggerated as Lin scored 13 points, had five assists and three turnovers in New York's 115-100 victory over the Indiana Pacers, who arrived in the Big Apple with a 25-16 record. The win put the Knicks (20-24) temporarily into the eighth and last Eastern Conference playoff berth, with the Milwaukee Bucks (19-24) playing later, and came on the back of a 42-point victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday. "Our energy and effort is a lot higher," Lin said after beating the Pacers. "Defensively, we are playing harder, we are playing together." Harvard graduate Lin must continue to show his much admired resiliency if he is to carry on the love affair with New York fans into next season and beyond. Lin rose from obscurity to lead the moribund Knicks on a seven-game winning streak last month with a rash of 20-point games when given a chance to run the point guard-dominated offense favored by D'Antoni. He has now been consigned to a lower profile role after the coach resigned on Wednesday with the team mired in a six-game losing streak. PICKING SPOTS The Knicks had floundered after the return of high-scoring Carmelo Anthony to D'Antoni's Lin-led attack and were going to rely more on established scorers Anthony and Amar'e Stoudemire, declared Woodson. "When I've got to get a big shot, I'm going to go to Melo and Amar'e, and guys that have done it," Woodson told reporters after his first formal practice with the team on Thursday. Lin said he was consciously trying to get the ball to Anthony and Stoudemire. "Especially out of the gate, trying to get them going," he said. "I'm picking my spots." The Knick burst out to a 24-14 lead in the first quarter and led by as many as 32 in the one-sided win over the Pacers, in which center Tyson Chandler and back-up guard J.R. Smith shared New York scoring honors with 16 points. "We are playing with more urgency now and that is important," Woodson said. Lin is being asked to master a more deferential style on court, and he played under greater control on Friday while still showing flashes of the creative playmaker that captivated the fans for a euphoric few weeks in February. If he fails to adapt, Lin's breakout campaign with the Knicks could be his last in New York. Given what he has shown as the key man in a motion offense and his commercial appeal that has seen his No. 17 jersey fly off shelves at the Garden, Lin should expect a sizeable increase from his minimum wage contract. Yet the Knicks may not be willing to use their $5 million mid-level exception budget on Lin in a more diminished role and he may be left to ply his trade elsewhere. If not valued by the Knicks, he may find a new welcoming home should mentor D'Antoni land another team to coach.

Credit: Reuters/Tomas Bravo By Dave Graham and Anahi Rama MEXICO CITY | Fri Mar 16, 2012 11:35pm EDT MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A government headed by Mexican presidential front-runner Enrique Pena Nieto would seek to tap foreign capital markets more and push ahead quickly with energy and tax reforms if he wins the July 1 election, his campaign chief said on Friday. Luis Videgaray, seen by many as a possible finance minister under Pena Nieto, who belongs to the opposition Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), told Reuters that his candidate was adamant about the need to boost sluggish domestic lending. Videgaray noted that the vast majority of Mexican federal debt was sold in pesos - to the extent that the government risked crowding out private sector lending. So it ought to raise the proportion that it sells to foreign investors, he said. Asked whether a PRI administration, which would begin in December 2012, would issue more of that debt denominated in dollars or euros, Videgaray said: "More in all (currencies). The thing is to take the decision to be funded more in international markets and less in local markets in order to free up domestic gold. The thing is (to see) how far international markets let us get," he added. Videgaray detailed a range of economic reforms in the interview that suggested the PRI would be far more market-friendly in power than it has been since 2000, when it became the opposition party. Changes also need to be made to rules governing bank capitalization and reserves that currently "penalize" lenders, Videgaray said. And it is vital to create a development bank in Mexico to spur commercial lending, Videgaray added. Domestic credit of all kinds provided by the banking sector was 45 percent of Mexico's gross domestic product in 2010 - far behind the United States, where the equivalent figure was 231.4 percent of GDP that year. In Latin America's biggest economy, Brazil, bank lending was more than double Mexico's rate. Investors are hopeful Pena Nieto, 45, will push through stalled reforms in Mexico if he is elected. In recent polls, Pena Nieto had a lead of between 7 and 18 points over his nearest rival, Josefina Vazquez Mota of President Felipe Calderon's conservative National Action Party (PAN). Until the PAN took power in 2000, the centrist PRI ruled Mexico for more than 70 years, a reign that was often dogged by accusations of corruption and authoritarianism. Several of the domestic reform plans outlined by Videgaray echo measures proposed by the PAN under Calderon and his predecessor Vicente Fox, whose efforts to overhaul the Mexican economy were often thwarted by the PRI in opposition. MORE COMPETITION Videgaray, who served as finance minister in the State of Mexico when Pena Nieto was governor, said the PRI would seek to foster competition in all sectors, including the telecommunication industry that tycoon Carlos Slim dominates. There is broad consensus in Mexico among the three main presidential hopefuls on the need to shake up competition, though progress has been halting due to political standoffs in Congress, where no party has had a majority for 15 years. A government headed by Pena Nieto would create special tribunals to handle competition disputes, which can get bogged down for years in legal maneuvering in Mexico, Videgaray said. Another of Pena Nieto's principal priorities to help boost Latin America's second biggest economy is to improve Mexico's weak tax take, which has made the government heavily dependent on state oil monopoly Pemex for revenues. A fiscal reform might extend to ending a value added tax exemption on food and medicine, if a way to offset the impact on the poor can be found, Videgaray added. Politicians, particularly in the PRI, have been wary of such a move because about half of Mexico's population lives in poverty. If the PRI wins the election, it would also push for quick approval of legislation aimed at liberalizing Mexico's labor market, Videgaray said. A bill designed to do this has been stalled in Congress for months, partly due to PRI objections. "The key issue in the labor market is flexibility," he said. Turning to foreign policy, Videgaray said ties with the United States, where Mexico sends nearly 80 percent of its exports, would be the most important for Pena Nieto. U.S. efforts to clamp down on illegal immigration, and Mexican concerns over the treatment of undocumented workers have vexed policymakers on both sides of the border for years. Videgaray said the PRI would seek to ease tensions. "Mexico will be interested in seeing how we can help the U.S. government to create the political conditions in the U.S. Congress for immigration reform in the United States," he said. "Our stance won't be to demand immigration reform, it'll be how can we help with an immigration reform." Videgaray also floated the idea that the two sides should increase cross-border integration in the service sector. He said one potential example that may be worth exploring is whether state-backed U.S. welfare programs like Medicaid or Medicare could be used to pay for some medical services in Mexico, arguing that the lower cost of treatment south of the border could result in major savings for U.S. public finances.

Pacific Office Properties Announces Delisting from NYSE Amex
| Reuters
Fri Mar 16, 2012 11:30pm EDT  Pacific Office Properties Announces Delisting from NYSE Amex  Pacific Office Properties Trust, Inc. (NYSE Amex: PCE) announced that it has notified the NYSE Amex (the Exchange) of its intent to file a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to effect the withdrawal of the Companys common stock from listing on the Exchange. The Company plans to file the Form 25 on or about March 26, 2012 and expects that its common stock will cease trading on the Exchange upon effectiveness of the Form 25 ten calendar days following its filing, on or about April 5, 2012. The Company anticipates that its common stock will begin quotation on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Marketplace (OTCQB Marketplace) thereafter. As previously disclosed, the Company was notified by the Exchange on April 19, 2011 that the Company was not in compliance with the continued listing standards specified in Section 1003(a)(i) of the Exchanges Company Guide because the Company had total equity of less than $2,000,000 and losses in two out of its three most recent fiscal years, and Section 1003(a)(ii) of the Company Guide because the Company had total equity of less than $4,000,000 and losses in three out of its four most recent fiscal years. The equity referenced above is determined under GAAP accounting and differs from the Companys net equity in its office portfolio. As permitted by Exchange rules, the Company submitted a plan that advised the Exchange of actions intended to be taken in the first quarter 2012 in order to regain compliance with continued listing standards (the Plan). The Company is withdrawing its common stock from listing on the Exchange because it has determined that it will not be able to make progress consistent with the Plan as required by the Exchange, and that it cannot reasonably expect to regain compliance in the projected timeframe. The Company believes that a self-initiated withdrawal will provide a more orderly transition of trading in its common stock to the OTC Marketplace or similar quotation service, and expects that following delisting, its common stock will be quoted on the OTCQB Marketplace. The OTCQB Marketplace is a market tier for over-the-counter-traded companies that are registered and reporting with the SEC. The Companys change in trading venue does not impact its obligation to file required reports with the SEC under applicable federal securities laws and should allow for a continued orderly trading market for the Company's common stock as it continues to pursue strategic alternatives.

Fed revises stress test losses
| Reuters
Fri Mar 16, 2012 11:27pm EDT * Fed makes slight changes to stress test calculations * Changes affect BofA, Citigroup, Ally Financial, Metlife, Wells Fargo * Capital ratios not affected under stress scenario By Alexandra Alper WASHINGTON, March 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve bank said on Friday it had made mistakes in calculating bank losses in stress test results released this week. But the Federal Reserve noted the revisions -- which affect Citigroup, Bank of America, and three others -- have no effect on key figures like capital ratios, which estimate how bank reserves would fare under scenarios imagined by the tests, which include skyrocketing unemployment, a tanking market and a deep recession. In results first released on Tuesday, the Fed gave glowing marks to most of the large banks, passing 15 out of 19 tested, and underscoring the recovery of the financial sector. But the central bank called out a few laggards, including Citigroup, forcing it and others to revise planned share buybacks and dividends. In revised figures released on Friday, the Fed reduced Citi's losses on first lien mortgages from $9.3 billion to $8.9 billion under the stressed scenario. The change occurred after the Fed decided to remove foreign mortgages from that calculation. Citi representatives were not immediately available for comment. The other banks affected by the revisions are Ally Financial , Metlife, and Wells Fargo. Citigroup, Ally Financial, Metlife and Sun Trust found themselves at the bottom of the stress test heap on Tuesday. Overall, for the 19 banks, the Fed's revisions slightly decreased losses on first lien mortgages from $61.5 billion to $61.1 billion. The calculations were based on estimated losses sustained by banks during a 27-month period in which unemployment hit 13 percent and housing prices drop by 21 percent. The bank holding companies whose balance sheets weathered the hypothetical storm best were Bank of New York Mellon with a Tier 1 common capital ratio of 13.1 percent, State Street Corp with 12.5 percent and American Express with 10.8 percent.

UPDATE 2-Mexican front-runner eyes quick reforms-aide
| Reuters
Fri Mar 16, 2012 11:22pm EDT * PRI government would seek to tap more foreign investors * Energy, fiscal reforms top priorities for Pena Nieto * Campaign chief says PRI will foster competition By Dave Graham and Anahi Rama MEXICO CITY, March 16 (Reuters) - A government headed by Mexican presidential front-runner Enrique Pena Nieto would seek to tap foreign capital markets more and push ahead quickly with energy and tax reforms if he wins the July 1 election, his campaign chief said on Friday.

Seaman NEW YORK | Fri Mar 16, 2012 11:13pm EDT NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A new study provides more evidence that physically active seniors may have a better overall health outlook. Out of 893 people around 80 years old, researchers found that the most active seniors had a lower risk of dying over the four-year study compared to those who moved the least. "It's another strong piece of evidence that all seniors should be participating in physical activities," said Dr. Catherine Sarkisian, director of the Los Angeles Community Academic Partnership for Research in Aging. Sarkisian, who was not involved in the new study, told Reuters Health this does not prove exercise makes people live longer. It could be that people who were healthy enough to exercise are the ones who would have lived longer anyway. However, she said there is enough evidence to suggest that people who are more physically active are less likely to lose their memory or have to go to a nursing home, for example. To see whether activity levels make a difference in lifespan, researchers led by Dr. Aron Buchman, a professor at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, measured the daily activity level of local seniors, most in their late 70s and 80s, over 10 days. The participants wore a small device on their wrists to record how much they were moving throughout the day. The researchers then followed the group for about four years, during which a quarter of the seniors -- 212 -- died. The seniors who were most active had about a 25 percent lower chance of dying compared to those who were least active over the four years, according to results published in the Archives of Internal Medicine. Buchman and his colleagues wrote that the link between physical activity and a lower risk of death remained even after taking into account traits that may have affected both seniors' exercise routine and chance of dying, including mental ability, chronic health conditions and symptoms of depression. "This suggests if you're increasing your activity -- even in your home -- it has some advantages," said Buchman. Sarkisian thinks there is a stereotype that seniors are too old to learn new habits, but she said past studies have shown the opposite. "Physical activity is one of the most important things that seniors can do to improve their health for the rest of their lives," she added. People are motivated to exercise for different reasons, said Sarkisian. Some may want to exercise after seeing a friend die, become ill or fall. Others may want to exercise because of the immediate physical benefits, such as improved mood. Older adults can check their local senior centers for exercise programs or talk to their doctors or a physical therapist for ideas, Sarkisian said. There are also programs tailored for people with physical limitations, such as those who are wheelchair bound or at an increased risk for falling. Buchman said it can also be as simple as an older person increasing their activities around the house. "If you can do light activity, do light activities."

Doctors' life-support skills fade after training

Credit: Reuters/Kevin Lamarque By Amy Norton NEW YORK | Fri Mar 16, 2012 11:12pm EDT NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Doctors and nurses are trained in how to save a cardiac arrest victim's life, but those skills can fade quickly if they're not used, a new study shows. In a review of 11 international studies, researchers found that health providers' skills in advanced life support typically deteriorated six months to a year after training, based on test performance. That's concerning, since the standard guideline calls for re-training every two years, note the researchers, led by Dr. Matthew Huei-Ming Ma of National Taiwan University Hospital. Advanced life support refers to the measures doctors and nurses can take when someone is in cardiac arrest, where the heart stops pumping blood to the rest of the body. Cardiac arrest is quickly fatal unless it's treated right away -- though treatment often fails too. Advanced life support includes the CPR chest compressions that laypeople are familiar with. But professionals can also give medication, clear the airways or use a defibrillator to "shock" the heart back into a normal rhythm. Many experts have long believed that re-training at two-year intervals is "not optimal," said Dr. Lance Becker, director of the Center for Resuscitation Science at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. "For those of us in the field, this isn't a new finding," Becker said of the study, which appears in the journal Resuscitation. But he added that he was glad to see the research on the question pulled together in a systematic review. Becker, who is also a spokesman for the American Heart Association (AHA), said that the standard recommendation for re-training remains every two years. But individual medical centers are taking their own steps, he told Reuters Health. At the University of Pennsylvania, for example, teams in the intensive care unit (ICU) will take 15 minutes to rehearse intubating a patient, using a mannequin. The center also has drills of sorts, where doctors and nurses will be called into a patient's room for a cardiac arrest, and only discover that it's a mannequin when they arrive. Then they proceed just as if it's a patient. "So they're practicing in the real environment that we're in," and not a classroom, Becker said. There are also "rolling refreshers," where a mannequin-toting cart is rolled around the ICU and offered up to anyone who wants to practice their life-support skills. "There are many places that are looking at this," Becker said. "We're trying to figure out the best ways to train adult learners." UNEVEN EVIDENCE FOR TWO YEAR INTERVAL At one time, he noted, doctors and nurses learned life-support skills only in a classroom. Now it's understood that real-life simulations make more sense. So why do widespread guidelines recommend re-training every two years? One reason, according to Becker, is that historically the two-year time frame was seen as convenient. Another, he said, is the lack of good research showing a shorter interval is necessary. Of the 11 studies in the review, Ma's team judged none to be any better than "fair" quality because of limits in their design. And many were more than a decade old. Without evidence from well-designed studies, it's hard to change guidelines, Becker noted. What's needed, he said, is more research into the best ways to train and retrain people in advanced life support. SOURCE: Resuscitation, online March 3, 2012.

Failing Hawk-Eye fills Del Potro with blind rage
| Reuters
By Mark Lamport-Stokes INDIAN WELLS, California | Fri Mar 16, 2012 11:02pm EDT INDIAN WELLS, California (Reuters) - Roger Federer eased imperiously past Juan Martin Del Potro 6-3 6-2 in the quarter-finals of the ATP tournament on Friday but it was the first game of the match that captured the most attention. Federer finally held serve after saving two break points in a game that lasted 11 minutes and involved heated controversy after the Hawk-Eye ball tracking system failed to work after a challenge by Del Potro. On the sixth deuce, a Federer first serve was ruled in by the line judge though the Swiss immediately prepared for a second serve. When Del Potro's challenge came to nothing, the disgruntled ninth seed argued with the chair umpire while motioning with his fingers that the ball had bounced at least four inches wide. "There was a problem with that call," Argentina's Del Potro, the ninth seed, told reporters. "It was clear out and the machine doesn't work. The chair umpire told me he made a mistake. "After that, I was not concentrating in the match and Roger was playing better, taking all his opportunities. I don't feel comfortable playing the match, but that was my problem. Roger made his job, and he's a good winner." In a statement, the ATP Tour said: "If Hawk-Eye does not have data, as per ATP rules, the original call stands. We understand there was a loss of an internet connection and the data could not be provided." Federer also felt his first serve had landed wide. "I thought the ball was out, and that was it, basically," the 30-year-old Swiss said. "And then you just go with the call of the umpire and you sort of move on with it. "You have these bad calls from time to time. You move on. There's a good call, bad call, the worst that can happen is you run out of challenges and the umpire then misses everything and the linespeople too." CONSECUTIVE TITLES Federer, who won three consecutive titles at Indian Wells from 2004, held serve on the next point when his opponent's backhand service return sailed wide. The Swiss broke Del Potro in the next game with a forehand volley winner at the net, after drawing the Argentinian forward with a delicate forehand drop shot, to lead 2-0. The next six games went with serve before Federer held in the ninth, clinching the opening set in 37 minutes when Del Potro dumped a forehand service return into the net. The Argentine was again broken in the first game of the second set, when Federer unleashed a crunching forehand crosscourt winner, and also in the fifth following another forehand winner by the Swiss. Oozing confidence, Federer served out to book his place in the last four, saving one break point in the eighth game before sealing victory on his third match point when Del Potro netted his service return. Federer, who had battled flu and a temperature to beat his first three opponents at Indian Wells, will face second-seeded Spaniard Rafa Nadal in Saturday's semi-finals.

A series of blunders by the United States, including the killings in Kandahar province on Sunday and the inadvertent burning of copies of the Koran at a NATO base last month, has further strained already tense relations between the countries. "This has been going on for too long. You have heard me before. It is by all means the end of the rope here," Karzai told reporters at the heavily fortified presidential palace. Flanked by senior officials, a tired and sometimes angry Karzai listened to village elders and the families of victims of the massacre, and dressed somberly in black for the start of an expected two days of talks to discuss the killings. Some at the meeting shouted, some demanded answers, but all said they wanted any soldiers involved punished. "I don't want any compensation. I don't want money, I don't want a trip to Mecca, I don't want a house. I want nothing. But what I absolutely want is the punishment of the Americans. This is my demand, my demand, my demand and my demand," said one villager, whose brother was killed in the nightime slaughter. Furious Afghans and lawmakers have demanded that the soldier responsible be tried in Afghanistan, but despite those calls, the U.S. staff sergeant was flown out on Wednesday. "The army chief has just reported that the Afghan investigation team did not receive the cooperation that they expected from the United States. Therefore these are all questions that we'll be raising, and raising very loudly, and raising very clearly," Karzai said. Karzai appeared to back the belief of the villagers, and many other Afghans including the country's parliament, that one gunman acting alone could not have killed so many people, and in different locations some distance apart. "They believe it's not possible for one person to do that. In (one) family, in four rooms people were killed, women and children were killed, and they were all brought together in one room and then put on fire. That one man cannot do," Karzai said. TWIN INVESTIGATIONS With twin investigations still underway by both U.S. and Afghan officials, any discovery of more than one soldier involved in the massacre would be a disaster for NATO, with Western leaders needing to win over Afghans ahead of a withdrawal by most foreign combat troops in 2014. Civilian casualties caused by NATO forces hunting insurgents are a major source of friction between the Afghan government and its Western backers, and have damaged efforts to win the "hearts and minds" of locals in the decade-old war. "Our families are finished and our houses are destroyed," said a furious Hajji Abdul Samad Aka, who lost 11 members of his family in the killings in two villages of Panjwayi district. An unnamed U.S. official told The New York Times the attack by the accused soldier was a result of "a combination of stress, alcohol and domestic issues - he just snapped." The lawyer for the soldier said the staff sergeant was upset at having to do a fourth tour of duty in a war zone and was likely suffering from stress after seeing colleagues wounded. Anger over the massacre spilled into weekly Friday prayers at a major mosques in central Kabul with one cleric calling the shooting "unforgivable" and questioning how a soldier with alleged mental problems could be in the U.S. military. "Revenge for the blood of these victims will be taken either today, tomorrow, in 10 years or the next 100 years," said Mullah Ayaz Niazi at Wazir Akhbar Khan mosque in Kabul's diplomatic enclave, which is also home to NATO headquarters. The soldier accused of the shooting was attached to a small special forces compound similar to others around the country which underpin NATO's anti-insurgent strategy. On Thursday, Karzai called for NATO troops to leave Afghan villages and confine themselves to major bases, underscoring fury over the massacre and clouding U.S. exit plans. He also demanded the handover of security to Afghan police and soldiers by 2013, a year ahead of schedule. Such a move could undercut U.S. President Barack Obama's strategy for Afghanistan and hamper efforts to mentor Afghan police and help with local governance. In a further blow to NATO hopes of a negotiated end to the decade-old war, the Afghan Taliban said they were suspending nascent peace talks with the United States, following the massacre and ahead of the traditional summer fighting months. The United States said it was committed to political reconciliation involving talks with the Taliban but progress would require agreement between Kabul and the insurgents. "The Taliban leadership were and may still be serious about talks, but instead of discussing how to end the war, they will now be persuading the rank and file to go out again this year and fight," Kate Clark of the Afghanistan Analysts Network said. "That another round of fighting and killing is now on the agenda is a difficult prospect to face," she wrote in a blog.
