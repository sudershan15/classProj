Text:Australia cenbank could force change in payments system
| Reuters
KANSAS CITY, March 30 | Thu Mar 29, 2012 11:59pm EDT KANSAS CITY, March 30 (Reuters) - Australia's central bank is considering forcing much-needed updates in the country's payments system, breaking a deadlock between competing banks that has held back innovation. Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Assistant Governor Malcolm Edey said the central bank was considering setting target dates for new standards to be adopted and then delegating an industry body to deal with the technological changes needed. "All of that would amount to a governance model where the regulator makes high-level decisions as to the public interest, while industry participants determine the most efficient means of implementing them," Edey said in prepared remarks to be delivered to a payments conference at the U.S. Kansas City Federal Reserve. The RBA, as regulator of the payments system in Australia, is in the finishing stages of a strategic review of necessary innovations, which was first begun in July 2010. Edey said he did not want to foreshadow the conclusions of the review but noted that the RBA could take a "more prescriptive approach" to setting objectives for members of the payments system. The RBA has been particularly keen to drive faster real-time payments at the retail level; greater access to payments systems outside normal banking hours; a greater capacity to send information with payments and easier ways to address payments. Banks and other interested parties in Australia have been reluctant to take on the cost of such updates when there was no clear proprietary benefits and the change could well lead to greater competition. The RBA has also been considering the need for a more centralised architecture for clearing and settlement of retail payments, known as hubs. Edey said such hubs may be more efficient than the current system and more conducive to both competition and innovation. However, that would have to be balanced against the costs of the investment. "Again, this is a key question of system design for which there needs to be a coordinated answer, whether the eventual decision is for or against," said Edey.

Oracle buys cloud company ClearTrial, gets closer to big pharma
| Reuters
By Jolie O'Dell at VentureBeat Thu Mar 29, 2012 11:59pm EDT Megalithic Silicon Valley oldster Oracle just announced its agreement to buy ClearTrial, a cloud-based company in the business of biopharmaceutical and medical trials. The company will be welcomed into the Oracle Health Sciences Suite, where it will become a key part of Oracle’s comprehensive closed-loop clinical trial management offering, with features guiding the client from planning to payment. To put it briefly and simply, clinical trials are those fun (and seemingly never-ending) periods of research and development for new medical drugs, devices, and procedures. ClearTrial is just software to help manage that process. Oracle aand ClearTrial reps say the software can speed up the planning process, improve budgeting accuracy, and give all parties involved transparency on timelines and how the trials went. ClearTrial’s current portfolio of clients includes some of the most well-known names in Big Pharma, such as Botox maker Allergan, Allegra and Ambien maker Sanofi, and AstraZeneca, the seventh-largest pharmaceutical company in the world. Research and clinical trials for products from companies like these can span many years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars; ClearTrial gets a microscopic piece of that pie, but it’s a huge pie to begin with. Oracle already has pieces of the clinical trial-management puzzle in place. For example, Oracle LabPas helps researchers find volunteers (read: human guinea pigs) for studies, and Oracle IRT helps researchers manage things like patient randomization and patient diary data. ClearTrial’s intellectual property rounds out the whole clinical trial offering to include planning, sourcing, and tracking these R&D-type activities. Oracle, founded in 1977, has disclosed the sale prices of around $2 billion worth of the companies it’s snapped up over the years. For many more deals, like this one with ClearTrial, the price remains unknown. “Biopharmaceutical, medical device and diagnostic companies, as well as contract research organizations (CROs), are facing increasing pressure to deliver clinical development projects on time and within budget,” said Neil de Crescenzo, senior vice president and general manager of Oracle Health Sciences, in a release. “Adding ClearTrial to the Oracle Health Sciences Cloud will help our customers streamline the clinical development process and help them bring therapies to market with greater predictability and at lower costs.” Image courtesy of REDAV, Shutterstock  Filed under: deals, VentureBeat Back to top Thomson Reuters is the world's largest international multimedia news agency, providing investing news, world news, business news, technology news, headline news, small business news, news alerts, personal finance, stock market, and mutual funds information available on Reuters.com, video, mobile, and interactive television platforms.

A molotov cocktail is thrown during a clash between student protesters and the government against plans to raise fuel prices in Jakarta March 27, 2012. Credit: Reuters/Beawiharta JAKARTA | Thu Mar 29, 2012 11:57pm EDT JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's parliament is set to vote on a controversial fuel price hike on Friday, with a leading political party threatening to scupper the plan in a move that could undermine confidence in Southeast Asia's largest economy. The government wants a 33 percent rise in petrol prices, currently the cheapest in Asia, from April 1 to reduce a swelling subsidy bill that threatens to undermine the budget discipline that led rating agencies to lift the country to an investment grade status. Failure to pass the proposal in parliament would keep inflation low but disappoint rating agencies and economists that want the government to use the $18 billion it spent on fuel subsidies last year for much-needed infrastructure instead. Lawmakers have been postponing a vote until the last minute as they fear supporting the move will hurt their popularity in the run-up to national elections in 2014. Protests over a fuel price hike helped spell the end for autocratic leader Suharto in 1998, and lifting prices would hurt the bulk of the country's 240 million people, many still living on a few dollars a day despite years of strong economic growth. Vocal protesters opposing the plan rallied across Indonesia this week, some clashing with riot police. The Golkar Party, part of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's ruling coalition, previously supported the fuel price rise but turned against it on Thursday. Without the support of Golkar, which has the second largest number of seats in parliament, the measure will not be able to pass. "The Golkar Party is of the view that at the present time there is no need to raise the fuel price," Golkar's secretary general Idrus Marham told local media late on Thursday. Golkar's deputy chairman, Priyo Budi Santoso, said the party would feel more comfortable if the parliamentary vote was held in secret, leading analysts to suggest its sudden opposition was an attempt to look good in front of the public or to extract last minute concessions from Yudhoyono. "The latest maneuver by Golkar is a smart calculation for 2014...this rejection of the fuel price hike could boost support for Golkar," said Syamsuddin Haris, a political analyst from Indonesia's Institute of Sciences. Subsidies keep pump prices at just half the market rate, spurring fuel demand in Asia's largest gasoline and diesel importer and helping boost car sales to record highs. Lifting prices by a third would only take them to a level reached in 2008 after Yudhoyono hiked prices following a oil price spike. The president cut prices after being re-elected for a second and final term in 2009, as oil prices declined during the global financial crisis. His plan to lift them again comes as oil prices have surged because of concerns over Iran's exports. "At this late stage, failure to have the fuel price plan approved by the legislature would be a major political blow for the administration and likely to have economic repercussions," said Jakarta-based risk analysts Concord Consulting. Without a price hike, the government sees the budget deficit widening to 4 percent of GDP, more than double the 1.5 percent it was aiming for this year. However, the central bank has said lifting fuel prices will boost inflation above its target to over 7 percent, from 3.6 percent in February. It is also likely to dampen consumer spending, the main driver of the economy in the G20 member. Indonesia, a former OPEC member, has long subsidized pump prices as do other major producers such as Iran, but declining crude output and dilapidated refineries mean it relies on costly motor fuel imports. Economists say weaning consumers off subsidies is critical to the country's long-term financial health.

TEXT-S&P Revises Fufeng Outlook To Negative; Afrms 'BB' Rating
| Reuters
Thu Mar 29, 2012 11:55pm EDT (The following was released by the rating agency) Overview -- Fufeng's profitability is likely to remain weak in the first half of 2012, and we have limited visibility over the likelihood of a recovery. -- Refinancing risk could increase for Fufeng's US$150 million convertible bond. -- For these reasons, we are revising our rating outlook on the China-based manufacturer of corn-based biochemical products to negative from stable. -- We are also affirming the 'BB' corporate credit rating on Fufeng and on its senior unsecured notes. Rating Action On March 30, 2012, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services revised its rating outlook on Fufeng Group Ltd. to negative from stable. At the same time, we affirmed the 'BB' long-term corporate credit rating on Fufeng and the 'BB' issue rating on the company's senior unsecured notes. Standard & Poor's also lowered its Greater China credit scale ratings on Fufeng and on the company's notes to 'cnBB+' from 'cnBBB-'. Fufeng is a China-based manufacturer of corn-based biochemical products. Rationale We revised the rating outlook on Fufeng to reflect our view that the company's profitability is likely to remain weak for at least the first half of 2012, following a deterioration in 2011. We have limited visibility over the potential for Fufeng's margins and profits to recover, given its current pricing strategy and volatility in raw material costs. A negative outlook signals at least a one-in-three probability of a downgrade over the next 12 months. Fufeng's margins could remain under pressure in 2012 because of its low prices. The company's pricing strategy is aimed at driving away smaller players so that the market is more likely to absorb the increased capacity of monosodium glutamate (MSG) produced at its new plant in northeast China. Fufeng's financial performance deteriorated in the second half of 2011 because of its reduced average selling price and a surge in the cost of raw materials, such as corn and coal. Fufeng's EBITDA margin in the second half of 2011 dropped more than we expected to 10.5% (2011: 13.1%), and its ratio of total debt to EBITDA was about 3.7x (2011: 3.3x). In our base-case scenario, Fufeng could maintain a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than 3.5x for 2012 if its margins improve to more than 11%, keeping the company above our threshold for a downgrade. Our assessment is based on the company's current sales volume and cost estimates. Fufeng's profitability could begin to strengthen in the second half of 2012 if raw material costs stabilize and the company increases its prices. Otherwise, the rating could come under downward pressure. The terms of Fufeng's US$150 million convertible bond will also weigh on the rating in 2012 by adding to its liquidity pressure. Holders have the option to require Fufeng to buy back the bond in April 2013. Fufeng's strong domestic market position in MSG, its good operating efficiency, and established distribution network support the current rating. The company's history of prudent operating and financial management is an additional strength. Liquidity We believe Fufeng's liquidity will remain "adequate" to cover its needs in the next 12 months, unless the company does not have a concrete refinancing plan in place over the next few months to repay the convertible bond. If no plan materializes, its liquidity position could quickly become "less than adequate". Our assessment of Fufeng's liquidity profile incorporates the following expectations and assumptions: -- The company's sources of liquidity, including cash, funds from operations, and available facilities, will exceed its uses by 1.2x or more over the next 12 months. -- Net sources will remain positive even if EBITDA declines more than 15%. -- Fufeng's cash on hand and cash flow from operations are sufficient to meet committed capital expenditure, working capital needs, debt repayments, and dividend payouts over the next 12 months. As of Dec. 31, 2011, Fufeng has unrestricted cash of about Chinese renminbi (RMB) 614 million with RMB704 million short-term debt due. We have not factored any major acquisitions into the ratings. Outlook The negative outlook reflects our expectation that company's financial performance will remain weak for at least the first half of 2012, following a deterioration in 2011. We also believe that refinancing risk could increase in 2012 as the maturity date of its US$150 million convertible bond approaches. We may lower the rating by one notch if: (1) Fufeng's margins and profitability do not improve in 2012 and show no signs of recovery, causing its ratio of total debt to EBITDA to exceed 3.5x; or (2) its liquidity position weakens. This could happen if the company materially increases its capital expenditure or working capital, or fails to execute a refinancing plan to redeem its convertible bond. We could revise the outlook to stable if the company restores its profitability and increases its prices while maintaining an "adequate" liquidity position by securing a refinancing plan to redeem its convertible bond.

Indonesia's Gudang Garam Q4 net profit falls 4 pct
| Reuters
JAKARTA, March 30 | Thu Mar 29, 2012 11:51pm EDT JAKARTA, March 30 (Reuters) - Gudang Garam, Indonesia's No.2 tobacco maker, on Friday said its fourth quarter 2011 net profit fell 4 percent, as costs increased to outweigh stable demand in Southeast Asia's largest economy. The firm's fourth quarter net profit was 1.10 trillion rupiah, compared with 1.15 trillion rupiah in the same period a year earlier, Reuters calculations showed based on published full-year and nine month results. Gudang Garam reported a full year 2011 net profit of 4.89 trillion rupiah, below analyst expectations. That compared with a net profit of 4.15 trillion rupiah in the year-ago period. Gudang Garam's 2011 full year net revenues rose 11 percent to 41.9 trillion rupiah, from 37.7 trillion rupiah a year earlier. The cigarette maker's shares were traded up 0.3 percent on Friday after the results. Its shares surged 55 percent in 2011, outperforming the 3.2 percent rise in the Jakarta index.

Seoul shares flat, set for strong quarterly finish
| Reuters
Thu Mar 29, 2012 11:50pm EDT * Quarterly gains could be most since Q3 of 2010 * KOSPI stuck in range as investors await key events * Profits locked in on recent gainers such as Samsung Elec * POSCO and STX shares advance on purchase of iron ore stake By Joonhee Yu SEOUL, March 30 (Reuters) - Seoul shares were steady on Friday, with investors at the sidelines ahead of a series of key events that could provide clearer market signals, and were poised to end the quarter with their best three-month showing in more than a year. "Momentum is still frozen as it has been for a while, with mixed data signals leaving no real impact whatsoever," said Lee Jae-hoon, an analyst at Mirae Asset Securities. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) was down 0.05 percent at 2,013.88 points as of 0240 GMT. It is up 10.3 percent since the beginning of the year, its best quarterly performance since a 10.2 percent rise in the third quarter of 2010. Investors locked profits on some recently outperforming blue-chips. Samsung Electronics fell 1.3 percent, on course for a three-day skid after hitting a record high on Tuesday. LG Display bounced 0.6 percent after a two-day slide that saw its share price tumble 7.7 percent following news of an LCD tie-up between its rivals Sharp and Hon Hai Precision. POSCO shares rose 1.3 percent after saying its consortium with Marubeni Corp and shipbuilder STX Corp will buy 30 percent of the Roy Hill iron ore project in Australia from Hancock Prospecting for A$3.5 billion ($3.61 billion). STX Corp shares gained 1.1 percent. Shipbuilders extended falls after a sharp decline on Thursday. Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering stumbled 3.4 percent while Samsung Heavy Industries slid 3.2 percent, with analysts pointing to a sobering shift in focus to upcoming first-quarter earnings. Investors will be eyeing European Union finance heads' discussions over the next few days on the region's bailout mechanism as well as China's official March PMI data on Sunday for further market cues.

Kurds struggle for recognition in Syrian revolt

Credit: Reuters/Shaam News Network/Handout By Khaled Yacoub Oweis ISTANBUL | Thu Mar 29, 2012 11:47pm EDT ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Veteran Kurdish human rights campaigner Radeef Mustafa lived in the shadow of huge Syrian secret police compounds towering over his decrepit hometown on the border with Turkey. When security police cracked his son's head open with an iron bar in a demonstration last year, Mustafa fled. He and his family came to Turkey where he joined the opposition Syrian National Council (SNC), hoping the year-long uprising against President Bashar al-Assad would end discrimination against the country's largest ethnic minority. His hopes were dashed, though, when the SNC, dominated by Islamists, vetoed a proposal at a meeting in Istanbul this week to recognize Syria's Kurds and their demand for self-rule. "This is chauvinism. The international community is worried about civil war and is demanding that the opposition guarantees minority rights," Mustafa told Reuters. "The Kurdish issue is a time bomb. It cannot be left to be decided when Assad falls." Constituting about 10 percent of the population, Syria's Kurds have long opposed the ruling Baath Party, but have largely stayed out of the latest demonstrations. If the Kurds fully joined attempts to overthrow Assad, it could prove decisive, a recent report by the Henry Jackson Society, a Britain-based think-tank, said. But deep internal divisions among the Kurds and distrust of the SNC and the other Arab-dominated opposition groups have so far kept the Kurds largely out of the fight. The Istanbul opposition meeting succeeded in reaching an agreement to expand and reform the SNC, and promised a democratic state and reconciliation once Assad is removed. But the Kurds walked out and refused to sign the declaration as there was no reference to rights for them as a community, only promises to recognize individual rights for all. SEPARATISM OR RIGHTS? Unlike Iraq, where Kurds rule a semi-autonomous region in the north, Syrian Kurdish leaders say they only want a federal system that would guarantee citizenship, property rights, Kurdish language education and an equitable budget distribution. They point to a wide distribution of Kurds across several regions of the country, and their integration into Syrian society and the job market, which makes autonomy impractical. Most of Syria's Kurds live in the east, where the country's oilfields lie, in the arid region of Ayn al-Arab, and in the Ifrin agricultural area on the border with Turkey. Large neighborhoods of the capital Damascus and the commercial hub of Aleppo, just 45 km (28 miles) east of the border with Turkey, also are dominated by Kurds. "When I went to school I did not know a word of Arabic and I was wondering why the teacher did not teach us to write Kurdish," said Mustafa, who is from Ayn al-Arab, a Kurdish town despite its name. "Our demands are about the right to learn our own language, to sing and to dance, and for compensation for historic discrimination," the burly, soft spoken activist said, referring to what he described as land taken from Kurds and given to Arabs along the Turkish border in the eastern province of Raqqa. But some in the opposition are wary that Kurdish demands could lead to separation and a copycat movement among other ethnic groups. Too much leeway for Kurds, they say, also could upset neighboring Turkey, which has a large and restive Kurdish population of its own, and undermine Ankara's support for the revolt. "The priority is to bring down Assad. We have agreed on general democratic principles and guaranteeing the national rights of everyone under the umbrella of the unity of Syria as a people and a landmass," said senior opposition figure Najati Tayyara, a liberal Sunni respected by the Kurds. In the middle of Ayn al-Arab, secret police headquarters and observation points stand like fortresses, in marked contrast to Mursitpinar, the neat Turkish town just across the border. The towns are separated by the old Berlin-to-Baghdad railway. Intelligence agents fled the compounds during protests that swept Kurdish areas of Syria in 2004, returning after Assad's forces put down the revolt, in which 30 people were killed. When the revolt against Assad's rule broke out in southern Syria, crowds took to the streets across Kurdish regions to denounce the president. Authorities, fearful of provoking the Kurds, generally have refrained from using deadly force to put down protests in Kurdish regions. REGIONAL RIVALRIES The Kurds also are deeply divided among themselves, with regional Kurdish parties backing rival groups and one Syrian Kurdish party taking sides with Assad and his government. Most Kurdish political parties united under the Kurdish National Congress (KNC) umbrella group this year to support the uprising and push Kurdish demands, but this has not translated into action on the streets, where demonstrations mostly are staged by young men with little party affiliation. The KNC is backed by the Kurdistan Regional Government in northern Iraq and was the main Kurdish faction that walked out of the Istanbul meeting. The other main Syrian Kurdish faction, the Democratic Union Party (PYD), is backed by the Turkish Kurd militant Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and has kept out of all opposition activities. Assad's father, the late Hafez al-Assad, for years sheltered PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, before the threat of a Turkish invasion in 1998 forced him to send Ocalan abroad where Turkish agents eventually captured him and brought him back to Turkey. Bashar al-Assad later cooperated with Turkey by cracking down on the PKK as relations between the two countries improved after he inherited power in 2000. Renewed Syrian backing for the PKK would be a further red line for Turkey which repeatedly has warned Assad over the violent crackdown on protests and escalating conflict. The PKK's Syrian proxy, the PYD, is accused by the Syrian opposition of acting as enforcers for Assad, putting down demonstrations in Kurdish areas and assassinating anti-Assad activists, most notably Mashaal Tammo, a charismatic Kurdish leader who was killed last year as he was seeking to form a broad-based anti-Assad political coalition. Assad made concessions to Kurds early in the uprising, such as a decree to grant stateless Kurds nationality they were deprived of as a result of a census in the 1960s, and easing laws making it difficult for Kurds to own property. But only an estimated 6,000 out of 150,000 stateless Kurds have been given nationality and most discriminatory regulations, including banning the teaching of Kurdish, are still on the books, Kurdish activists say. Tension also have risen between Assad's opponents and the Kurds after the opposition declaration on Wednesday pledged "equality to all citizens regardless of their religion or ethnicity" but did not mention the Kurds by name. "Saideline Ismail, a senior Kurdish politician and a member of the Kurdish National Congress said he was dismayed that the SNC, led by Burhan Ghaloiun, a Paris-based secular professor, opposed mentioning the Kurdish cause. "I don't understand why they did not make an effort to gain the Kurdish street," he said. "The Kurds are the first who want to see the downfall of the Assad regime and are demanding a right of self determination within a united Syria."

Mexico's Pemex signs deep water oil drilling safety contract
| Reuters
MEXICO CITY, March 29 | Thu Mar 29, 2012 11:40pm EDT MEXICO CITY, March 29 (Reuters) - Mexico's state oil monopoly Pemex signed a contract with a company specializing in oil spill clean ups to boost its safety controls as it plunges into exploration of deep waters in the Gulf of Mexico. Pemex said in a statement on Thursday that Wild Well Control, which was heavily involved in efforts to cap BP's Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010, will help Pemex comply with regulations put in place by the country's oil watchdog the National Hydrocarbons Commision (CNH). Pemex has limited experience in deep water drilling but estimates there are more than 29 billion barrels of crude equivalent, or 58 percent of the country's prospective resources, in the Gulf. The country needs to exploit that oil to boost government finances, which depend heavily on crude exports. Oil output in the world's No. 7 producer has fallen sharply from a 2004 peak of 3.4 million barrels per day (bpd) to stabilize at around 2.5 million bpd. A 2008 oil reform opened up the nationalized oil sector to more private investment, allowing Pemex to sign oil-field operating contracts in deep water with private companies. The CNH is concerned Mexico on its own is not ready to take on ultra-deep projects like the Maximino well, which is planned for next year at around 10,000 feet (3,000 meters), six times deeper than Pemex has drilled before.

Can big data improve national security? Obama Admin commits $200M to find out

By Jennifer Van Grove at VentureBeat Thu Mar 29, 2012 11:39pm EDT Positing that data analysis on a grand scale can solve the nation’s most critical challenges, the Obama Administration has kicked off a big data initiative with $200 million in commitments from six federal agencies. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) is collaborating with the Department of Defense (DoD), National Science Foundation (NSF), Nation Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Energy (DoE), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to better organize and understand massive volumes of digital data for the nation’s well-being, the Administration announced Thursday. “In the same way that past Federal investments in information-technology R&D led to dramatic advances in supercomputing and the creation of the Internet, the initiative we are launching today promises to transform our ability to use Big Data for scientific discovery, environmental and biomedical research, education, and national security,” assistant to the President and OSTP director Dr. John P. Holdren said. Each of the agencies involved are committing resources to developing technologies for big data insight and discovery. DARPA and the DoD, for instance, are specifically focusing on analytics, tools, and algorithms for improving national security and optimizing warfare tactics. The government is the latest investor in the big-data movement, which has taken off in the technology sector as service providers raise large rounds or get snatched up for tools that dive deep into corporate data pools.
