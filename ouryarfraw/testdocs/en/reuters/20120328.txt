| Reuters
HONG KONG, March 29 | Wed Mar 28, 2012 11:59pm EDT HONG KONG, March 29 (Reuters) - Air China Ltd , the national flag carrier of the country, said on Thursday that it has not cut or cancelled any Airbus aircraft orders, and plans to expand capacity. "We will expand capacity by 8 percent on domestic routes and 12 percent on international routes this year," Chairman Wang Changshun told reporters at a result briefing. The carrier reported a 41 percent drop in 2011 net profit to 7.08 billion yuan ($1.12 billion) on rising costs, a continuing recession in the international air passenger market and a significant decline in air cargo operations.   Air China has orders for a total of 51 Airbus planes to be delivered through 2014, including 30 A320/310 and 21 A330, the company said. At the end of 2011, its fleet comprised 432 aircraft with an average age of 6.77 years.

JAL to tap Qantas, other Oneworld partners for IPO -sources
| Reuters
TOKYO, March 29 | Wed Mar 28, 2012 11:57pm EDT TOKYO, March 29 (Reuters) - Japan Airlines is planning to tap Australia's Qantas, British Airways owner IAG and other members of the Oneworld alliance as possible investors in its initial public offering, three people with knowledge of the Japanese carrier's strategy said. Japan Airlines (JAL) is planning to raise at least 500 billion yen ($6.03 billion) ahead of a relisting of its shares in Tokyo as early as September, sources have told Reuters, allowing a state-backed fund to recoup the 350 billion yen it injected into the company after its bankruptcy in 2010. The former national flag carrier is eager to secure a group of stable shareholders. In Japan it is targeting banks, trading companies and other business partners as possible investors in the IPO. The move to add Oneworld members to its list of shareholders is aimed at bolstering overseas routes - a key plank of its rebuilding strategy - in addition to helping it reach a target of putting 10 to 20 percent of its stock in stable hands. Last week JAL Chairman Masaru Onishi met with Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce, IAG's Willie Walsh and other Oneworld leaders at a gathering in Berlin. Onishi explained JAL's recovery from bankruptcy and its business strategy, one of the people said. JAL has not yet officially filed for its IPO and regulations restrict Onishi and other JAL executives from soliciting investments or talking in detail about its IPO plans at this stage. But the context of such conversations is clear, the people said. "There is a mutual understanding without the issue being explicitly addressed," said one of the people, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. "This is a move to secure stable shareholders." JAL declined to comment. JAL joined Oneworld in 2007, one of the three major global alliances which pool frequent flyer miles and feed passengers between airlines. Other members include Cathay Pacific Airways , American Airlines and Finnair. Qantas and IAG are seen as two of the most likely to invest given their size and status as core members of Oneworld. But JAL will continue talking with all members with an eye towards them participating in the IPO, one of the people said. Any commitment would likely be limited to a few percent, and be viewed by both sides more as a way to bolster ties rather than as a financial investment. Japanese law limits foreign ownership in an airline to one third. "It is not clear yet whether an investment will be 1 percent, 2 percent or even 10 percent. It all depends on the partner," said one of the people. "We want to build stronger ties."

TEXT-S&P lowers Renhe rating to 'B'; puts on Watch Negative
| Reuters
Wed Mar 28, 2012 11:54pm EDT (The following was released by the rating agency) Overview -- We believe that Renhe's liquidity could deteriorate more than we expected following the company's guidance that its property sales will be significantly lower in 2012. -- Limited bank funding in a tight credit environment constrains the liquidity and sales of the Chinese shopping mall developer and operator, in our opinion. -- We are lowering our long-term corporate credit rating on Renhe and the rating on its senior unsecured notes to 'B' from 'B+'. -- We are placing all the ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications.  Rating Action On March 29, 2012, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services lowered its long-term corporate credit rating and the issue rating on Renhe Commercial Holdings Co. Ltd. to 'B' from 'B+'. At the same time, we placed all the ratings, including our 'cnBB-' Greater China scale credit ratings on Renhe and its senior unsecured notes, on CreditWatch with negative implications. Renhe is a China-based underground shopping mall developer and operator.  Rationale We lowered the ratings because Renhe's property sales and liquidity could weaken significantly more than we expected in 2012. Our view reflects the company's announcement with the release of its 2011 results that it targets property sales for this year of Chinese renminbi (RMB) 3.0 billion-RMB4.0 billion, which is 50% lower than our base case. We also expect much lower cash collection than we previously anticipated for 2012, due to canceled property sales in 2011. In our opinion, the company has limited funding channels to restore its financial strength against a weak property sales outlook. We believe that Renhe's business model is vulnerable to tight credit conditions, the company's limited access to bank borrowings, and generally anemic investment demand. Renhe doesn't hold land use rights on the underground commercial properties that it develops. Because of this, the company has not received meaningful onshore bank credit to fund the construction of its projects. Further, it provides guarantees to banks for buyers to obtain loans to purchase its properties. We placed the ratings on CreditWatch because we believe Renhe's liquidity could deteriorate to "weak" from "less than adequate", as defined in our criteria, in 2012. The company canceled presales of RMB3 billion at its project in Humen, Dongguan last year. This reduced its 2011 presales to RMB4.0 billion--about 50% lower than our expectation. In addition, Renhe's collection period for sales proceeds has increased significantly due to tight bank credit. The company also has limited flexibility to scale back construction spending on presold but incomplete projects.  Liquidity In our view, Renhe's liquidity is "less than adequate". We expect the company's liquidity sources to cover its uses by about 1.0x in 2012. However, its liquidity is highly sensitive to property sales, cash collection, and construction spending. The company's receivables that are more than six months past due increased to RMB1,224.7 million at the end of 2011, from RMB12.5 million a year earlier. Renhe has short-term onshore debt of RMB555.3 million and interest expenses of about RMB800 million (on both its offshore notes and onshore debt) due in 2012.  CreditWatch We aim to resolve the CreditWatch action within the next three months. We may lower the rating on Renhe by at least one notch if we assess that the company's liquidity will deteriorate to "weak". This means that the company's sources of liquidity will be lower than its uses over the next 12 months.  Related Criteria And Research -- Renhe Commercial Holdings Co. Ltd.

TEXT-Fitch: Azerbaijan Banks Have Stabilised, But Vulnerabilities Remain
| Reuters
Wed Mar 28, 2012 11:53pm EDT (The following was released by the rating agency) Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: Azerbaijanâ's Banking Sector: Emerging from Crisis here LONDON/MOSCOW, March 28 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings says in a newly-published report that the credit metrics of Azerbaijan's banks have stabilised since the height of the global financial crisis, and currently high oil prices are supporting asset quality and liquidity in the sector. However, credit impairment remains significant following rapid pre-crisis growth, and loan recoveries are hampered by weak governance and transparency in the corporate sector and a still depressed real estate market. Limited profitability and often moderate capital cushions restrict banks' ability to absorb losses, and the system, like the broader economy, remains highly exposed to any significant negative oil price shock. Fitch expects loan growth in 2012 to remain broadly in line with the 21% expansion reported for 2011. New credit is being extended primarily to the retail and SME segments, an expansion supported by the currently moderate leverage in the economy: loans/GDP stood at 20% at end-2011, with loans/non-oil GDP at 45%. However, weaknesses in the corporate sector, a deceleration of real GDP growth rates and the tighter monetary stance of the authorities are constraining credit expansion. Sector development is also undermined by the capital deficit of the International Bank of Azerbaijan (IBA), the country's largest bank accounting for nearly 35% of system assets. In February 2012, after a protracted period of capital ratio breaches by IBA, the authorities announced a recapitalization plan for the bank involving contributions of both subordinated debt and equity. Although these measures will help to bring IBA's capital ratios into compliance with statutory requirements, Fitch believes they are likely to be still insufficient relative to the bank's asset quality problems (see 'Fitch Maintains IBA's IDR on RWN; Downgrades Viability Rating', dated 27 February 2012 at www.fitchratings.com). The level of non-performing loans (NPLs, 90 days overdue), estimated by Fitch based on a survey of rated banks, stabilized at a high 14% at end-2011. However, restructured/rolled-over exposures, equal to at least a further 11% of loans, suggest potential for additional future impairment recognition. In addition to deficiencies in the operating environment, asset quality has been undermined by often weak loan underwriting at banks. Increased competition for SME and retail borrowers also carries a risk of less stringent credit standards in this segment. Against this background, Fitch considers the capital cushions of the majority of rated banks to be only moderate. Excluding IBA, the loss absorption capacity of Fitch rated banks (calculated as the maximum total amount of reserves that they could create without breaching minimum capital requirements) stood on average at around 12% of their aggregate loan books at end-2011. The agency notes that weak internal capital generation (reflected in a sector return on average assets of 1% in 2011) is likely to persist on the back of more moderate growth, continuing recognition of credit impairment from legacy loans, tighter competition and the limited scale and high cost bases of many banks. Fitch expects that, barring external shocks, the system will continue its slow recovery, supported by generally comfortable liquidity resulting from the fast growing retail deposit base. The loans/deposits ratio was still a high 1.5x at end-2011, although non-customer funding comes mainly from government agencies and international financial institutions, mitigating refinancing risks. The Viability Ratings of Fitch-rated Azerbaijan banks are currently in the 'b' category or below, and the agency does not expect any marked upward movement in the medium term given weaknesses in the operating environment and the banking system. IBA's Long-term Issuer Default Rating of 'BB+'/Rating Watch Negative continues to reflect the agency's base case expectation that the authorities will ultimately provide sufficient capital support for the bank.

China's ZTE says Iran restrictions to have little impact on sales
| Reuters
HONG KONG, March 29 | Wed Mar 28, 2012 11:52pm EDT HONG KONG, March 29 (Reuters) - ZTE Corp , China's second-largest telecommunications equipment maker, said on Thursday that limitations on its business operations in Iran will have little impact on overall sales. President Shi Lirong, speaking at a news conference after the company announced its financial results for 2011, said ZTE was not a mainstream telecoms gear supplier in Iran. ZTE said on Wednesday that October-December net profit slid to 991 million yuan ($157 million), down 48 percent from 1.89 billion yuan a year earlier. Shares in ZTE had risen nearly 5 percent by 0346 GMT, outpacing a 1 percent drop in the broader Hang Seng Index , amid market expectations for an improved outlook. Reuters reported last week that ZTE had entered into a $131 million contract with Telecommunication Co of Iran in December 2010, which sources said included a surveillance system capable of monitoring telephone and Internet communications. ZTE has said it is no longer seeking to expand in Iran.

TEXT-Fitch: Sharp-Hon Hai Deal Positive but No Rating Impact
| Reuters
Wed Mar 28, 2012 11:46pm EDT (The following was released by the rating agency) SEOUL/SINGAPORE, March 28 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings says that Sharp Corporation's (Sharp, 'BBB-'/Negative) proposed stake sale in a subsidiary to Taiwan-based Hon Hai Group (Hon Hai) is positive for the company's credit profile. However, the benefits are not sufficient to mitigate the credit risks surrounding Sharp for Fitch to change its Negative Rating Outlook. On 27 March 2012 the company announced that it will sell new equity of 9.9% and existing equity of 46.5% in Sharp Display Products Corp (SDPC) to Hon Hai for JPY66bn and JPY66.5bn respectively. SDPC owns Sharp's LCD production plant at Sakai, Osaka. Fitch notes that Sharp remains exposed to the loss-making LCD TVs and panel industry, which is facing weak demand, industry overcapacity and pricing pressure amid yen appreciation. Fitch expects Sharp's FY12 EBIT margin to be negative. Improvement in Sharp's FY13 EBIT margin will depend on industry dynamics and its ability to introduce newer technologies and to compete with Korean manufacturers, principally Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd (Samsung, 'A+'/Stable) and LG Electronics Inc. (LGE, 'BBB'/Negatve). As part of the transaction, Hon Hai also committed to take 50% of Sharp's Sakai LCD output, which would improve Sharp's capacity utilisation and reduce the risk of further impairment losses. Sharp's ratings Outlook may be revised to Stable if performance in the TV and LCD panel segments leads to an overall FY13 EBIT margin above 1.5%, positive free cash flow (FCF) generation or funds from operations (FFO)-adjusted leverage below 3.5x, on a sustained basis. However, Fitch may consider a downgrade if Sharp's FFO-adjusted leverage rises above 4.0x or if the EBIT margin and FCF are negative on a sustained basis. Hon Hai, led by Hon Hai Precision Industry Company, is the world's largest electronics manufacturing company. The company is one of the top suppliers for US-based Apple Inc., from which it derives 40% of its revenue. Sharp's ratings: - Long-Term Foreign-Currency (FC) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB-'; Outlook Negative - Local-Currency (LC) IDR at 'BBB-'; Outlook Negative - LC senior unsecured rating at 'BBB-' - Short-Term FC and LC IDRs at 'F3' Back to top Thomson Reuters is the world's largest international multimedia news agency, providing investing news, world news, business news, technology news, headline news, small business news, news alerts, personal finance, stock market, and mutual funds information available on Reuters.com, video, mobile, and interactive television platforms.
