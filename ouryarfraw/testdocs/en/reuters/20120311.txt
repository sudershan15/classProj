S&P Rates Agile's Proposed Senior Unsecured Notes 'BB'
| Reuters
Sun Mar 11, 2012 11:52pm EDT (The following was released by the rating agency) HONG KONG (Standard & Poor's) March 12, 2012--Standard & Poor's Ratings Services said today that it had assigned its 'BB' issue rating and 'cnBBB-' Greater China credit scale issue rating to the proposed issue of U.S.-dollar fixed-rate senior unsecured notes by Agile Property Holdings Ltd. (BB/Stable/--; cnBBB-). The rating is subject to our review of the final issuance documentation. The company will use the net proceeds from the proposed issuance to purchase new land sites, for refinancing and general working capital purposes. The issue rating is the same as the corporate credit rating on Agile because we believe the company's ratio of priority debt to total assets will likely remain below our threshold of 15% for speculative-grade debt. The rating on Agile reflects the company's sales concentration in Guangdong and Hainan provinces and execution risks associated with its expansion outside these markets. The rating also reflects the risk of operating in China's highly competitive and volatile real estate market with evolving regulatory policies. Agile's established market position in Guangdong and Hainan, its sizable low-cost land bank, and operating and financial management track record temper these weaknesses. The stable outlook on Agile reflects our expectation that the company's property sales and capital structure will largely remain stable in the next year. We also expect the company to continue to manage its expansion and leverage with caution.

Japan machinery orders rise, capex recovery seen

Credit: Reuters/Chang-Ran Kim By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Stanley White TOKYO | Sun Mar 11, 2012 11:42pm EDT TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders rose at a faster pace than expected in January in a sign that rebuilding the country's tsunami-battered northeast coast could propel capital expenditure and support the fragile economy. Core machinery orders, which help gauge the strength of capital spending, rose 3.4 percent in January from the previous month, beating a median market forecast for a 1.6 percent increase. The data bolsters the argument that domestic demand can drive the world's third-biggest economy this year as the country rebuilds from last year's disaster and could stay the hand of the Bank of Japan when it starts a two-day policy meeting later on Monday. Other recent data, including larger-than-expected gains in industrial output and an upward revision to fourth quarter gross domestic product, also raised hopes that Japan's economy will gather momentum this year. "The data shows corporate capital spending is rising moderately thanks partly to reconstruction-related demand, although the momentum is not that strong," said Junko Nishioka, chief economist at RBS Securities in Tokyo. "As reconstruction shifts to a higher gear, corporate capital spending is expected to pick up in April-June this year. As the yen has eased and corporate profits are expected to recover, the economy is likely to maintain a moderate recovery." The central bank is expected to stand pat on policy at a two-day policy meeting starting on Monday, even as politicians call for another "big bang" stimulus to shore up the economy. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Graphic on machinery orders: link.reuters.com/bek95s Graphic on CGPI: link.reuters.com/vef36s ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> WEAKENING YEN Japan's Nikkei share average .N225 broke above 10,000 in early trade on Monday, boosted by another robust U.S. jobs report that pointed to a strengthening U.S. economic recovery and helped to lift the dollar to a nearly 11 month high of 82.64 yen. The weakening yen may be a source of comfort for Japan's policymakers and exporters, who have struggled with historic gains in the currency since last summer that threatened to derail the recovery from last year's March 11 earthquake. But a weaker yen could also take its toll on resource-poor Japan by increasing the cost of fuel imports, which have risen following the nearly complete shutdown of its nuclear power sector after the Fukushima disaster. The weaker yen and higher cost of fuel imports could prolong Japan's trade deficit, gradually depriving it of the ability to finance its massive debt. Compared with a year earlier, core machinery orders increased 5.7 percent, better than the median forecast for a 4.0 percent annual increase. Japanese wholesale prices rose 0.6 percent in the year to February, matching the median forecast from economists. JPCGPY=ECI With market jitters easing over Greek debt swap talks, while the yen is weakening and share prices are rising, the central bank is unlikely to move again after last month's surprise easing, sources familiar with its thinking say. The BOJ surprised markets on February 14 by easing monetary policy with a 10 trillion yen ($123 billion) increase in government bond purchases and set an inflation goal of 1 percent.

JGBs inch up but hold ranges as BOJ outcome awaited
| Reuters
TOKYO | Sun Mar 11, 2012 11:42pm EDT TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese government bonds inched higher on Monday, but stuck close to recent ranges as investors awaited the outcome of the Bank of Japan's regular two-day policy meeting now underway. At its two-day meeting which concludes on Tuesday, the BOJ is expected to extend a loan programme for growth industries and stress its readiness to take more monetary steps. Some market participants attributed the firmer market tone to shortcovering, but strategists expect limited moves for the time being, ahead of the close of Japan's fiscal year. "We're approaching the fiscal year end, so no one wants the market to move much, or volatility to pick up. It will be business as usual this week," says Shogo Fujita, chief Japan bond strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "Last week, the focus was on Greece, but this week, the market is turning to macro economic factors." Ten-year JGB futures rose 0.15 point to 142.44, while the yield on the latest 10-year JGB slipped half a basis point to 0.980 percent. The yield on the 20-year note fell one basis point to 1.755 percent. JGBs shrugged off data released early in the session that showed Japan's core machinery orders rose at a faster pace than expected in January. Japanese government bond market participants expect the benchmark 10-year yield to creep higher this week, after robust U.S. jobs figures raised prospects of a continued economic recovery, quashing demand for safe-haven assets, a Reuters weekly survey showed on Monday. The U.S. Labor Department said on Friday that U.S. employers added more than 200,000 jobs for a third straight month. Policymakers at the U.S. Federal Reserve will also meet on Tuesday this week to review rates. "Both U.S. and Japanese central banks are likely to stay on hold this week after Greece reached a debt deal," Satoshi Yamada, chief quantitative analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities, said in a weekly JGB survey response. "There is a 20-year JGB auction later this week so the yield curve could steepen but there might be some buying after the auction so rise in yields would be limited," he added.

Japan PM says yen still overvalued, finance minister repeats warning

Credit: Reuters/Kyodo TOKYO | Sun Mar 11, 2012 11:36pm EDT TOKYO (Reuters) - The yen remains overvalued despite its recent steep fall from historic peaks versus the U.S. dollar, Japan's prime minister said on Monday, while the country's finance minister kept up a warning against speculative currency moves. "Compared to record highs seen last October the yen has weakened but as a trend it is still somewhat overvalued ... The yen is valued highly in relative terms when considering fundamentals," Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said in parliament. Finance Minister Jun Azumi added there was no change in Japan's stance of taking steps against speculative moves in currency markets, though he declined to say whether the yen is correctly valued at present. "As I've said before, we will take firm action against excessive and speculative moves," Azumi said at the same parliamentary committee meeting. He acknowledged that a strong yen damages the global competitiveness of Japanese firms. When urged by an opposition lawmaker to step into forex markets more frequently, Azumi said there were no constraints on intervention by Japan, though the fact it regularly discloses intervention amounts makes it different from emerging economies that heavily intervene to weaken their currencies. The yen in early February advanced towards a record high against the dollar, but it has retreated nearly 10 percent after monetary easing from the Bank of Japan and brighter prospects for the U.S. economy. The dollar was down 0.3 percent at 82.16 yen, hovering below a 10-1/2 month high above 82.60 yen hit on Friday.<FRX/> (Reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro and Rie Ishiguro; Editing by Joseph Radford) Back to top Thomson Reuters is the world's largest international multimedia news agency, providing investing news, world news, business news, technology news, headline news, small business news, news alerts, personal finance, stock market, and mutual funds information available on Reuters.com, video, mobile, and interactive television platforms.

FOREX-Dollar hits 3-week high vs euro after jobs data
| Reuters
Sun Mar 11, 2012 11:35pm EDT * Dlr in favour, jobs data seen reducing need for Fed action * Euro shows muted reaction to Greek deal * Fed, BOJ policy meetings this week in focus By Masayuki Kitano SINGAPORE, March 12 (Reuters) - The dollar hit a three-week high versus the euro on Monday after last week's upbeat jobs data suggested the U.S. economy may not be in dire need of further monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve. The euro struggled after facing what traders described as a buy-the-rumour-sell-the-fact fall on Greece's bond swap deal with private creditors which will clear the way for a new bailout. The single currency slipped 0.2 percent to $1.3095, having dipped to as low as $1.3085 at one point on trading platform EBS, the euro's lowest level since Feb. 16. Possible support for the euro lies near $1.3055, the 50 percent retracement of its January to February rally. "There's a risk of euro/dollar sustaining a move below $1.31," said Mitul Kotecha, head of global foreign exchange strategy for Credit Agricole in Hong Kong. "There's worries about whether Portugal will follow Greece, whether Greece will need another bailout, whether the underlying issues in the country will be resolved," Kotecha said. "I just think there's a lot of potential uncertainties and negatives for the market to chew on at the moment that will limit any euro upside," he added. With the euro in retreat, the dollar edged up against a basket of major currencies and touched a three-week high of 80.104. U.S. jobs data on Friday showed employers added more than 200,000 workers to their payrolls for a third straight month in February, a sign the economy was strengthening. "That is certainly supportive for the dollar," said Greg Gibbs, strategist at RBS in Sydney. A Reuters poll conducted after the release of the employment data on Friday showed that recent signs of improvement in the U.S. labor market were spurring economists at major Wall Street firms to rethink how aggressive the Fed needs to be in applying further monetary stimulus. Economists at most primary dealers - the large financial institutions that do business directly with the Fed - still believe the central bank will undertake another large stimulus programme. However, they now expect the scale of this intended economic support to be smaller than they thought a month ago. The dollar dipped 0.3 percent against the yen to 82.19 yen , coming under pressure due to profit-taking, traders said. The greenback had climbed to 82.65 yen on Friday on trading platform EBS, its highest level since late April 2011, as U.S. Treasury yields rose on the back of the upbeat jobs data, making the dollar more attractive against the low-yielding Japanese currency. A focal point for dollar/yen this week will be policy decisions by the Bank of Japan and the U.S. Federal Reserve, both of which are due on Tuesday. The BOJ's monetary policy has been in the spotlight after its surprise decision in February to expand its asset-buying scheme by 10 trillion yen helped trigger a broad slide in the yen. On Tuesday, the BOJ is seen likely to hold off from expanding its asset buying scheme further, and may instead stress its readiness to offer further monetary stimulus in coming months if needed.

Reprisals kill 10 after church bombed in Nigeria's Jos

Credit: Reuters/Stringer By Buhari Bello JOS, Nigeria | Sun Mar 11, 2012 11:32pm EDT JOS, Nigeria (Reuters) - Christian youths killed at least 10 people in reprisal attacks after a suspected suicide bomber hit a Catholic church in the central Nigerian city of Jos on Sunday, killing three people, authorities said. "The situation is bad," Sati Dakwat, health commissioner for Jos, told Reuters. "Several were killed in the reprisal attacks, more than 10." A Reuters reporter at the scene of the church bombing was unable to gain access, as the police had cordoned off the area around Finber's Catholic Church in the Rayfield suburb of Jos. "We haven't got actual figures of injured yet, but at least three people have been confirmed dead by our men attending the scene of the blast," the Jos coordinator for the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) Al Hassan Aliyu said. But he later added that "the situation is calm now", after the initial reprisals by Christian youths. Earlier NEMA called it a suspected suicide bombing, but Aliyu said this was not yet confirmed. Islamist sect Boko Haram has claimed responsibility for a wave of bomb attacks on churches across Nigeria since Christmas Day. The bombing campaign has raised fears that the group is trying to ignite sectarian conflict in Africa's most populous country, split roughly evenly between Christians and Muslims. In the past decade Jos has become the main flashpoint for tensions between Nigeria's Christian and Muslim communities. Bombers have targeted its churches many times since Christmas. A Reuters witness watched angry Christians set up road blocks near the church. In the past, such a move has preceded retaliatory violence against Muslims. President Goodluck Jonathan, whose term has almost come to be dominated by the insurgency in the north, condemned the bombings, a statement from his office said. "Despite seeming appearances to the contrary, government is indeed winning the war against the terrorists and will continue to progressively destroy their ability to unleash murderous attacks on peaceful, law-abiding Nigerians," it said. "Their hideouts and modus operandi are also being consistently exposed." Boko Haram, whose name means "Western education is forbidden", wants sharia law more widely applied across Nigeria. The sect has been waging an insurgency against Nigeria's government since 2009, and has been blamed for hundreds of killings in gun and bomb attacks. SECT STIRS TURBULENCE Styled on the Taliban, Boko Haram's methods have become more sophisticated in the past six months, and it has widened its targets beyond the police and other authority figures to include Christian worshippers. On February 26 a suicide bomber drove a car packed with explosives into a church in Jos, killing two people and wounding 38. Christian youths beat two Muslims to death in revenge. Other cities also have been affected. A bomb at a Catholic Church in Madala, just outside the capital Abuja, killed 37 people and wounded 57 on Christmas Day. Another blast struck a church in Jos. Boko Haram claimed responsibility for previous attacks on churches, citing violence against Muslims by Christians in Jos as justification. Despite its Islamist ideology, it is Muslims in the north of Nigeria who mostly bear the brunt of the sect's violence. Police killed a suspected Boko Haram fighter and arrested 11 others in the sect's northeastern heartland of Maiduguri on Saturday, Borno state police spokesman Samuel Tizhe said. He said they had tried to attack a mobile police base, but were repelled. He said one of the gunmen was killed, 11 were arrested and arms and explosive devices were seized from them. Earlier on Saturday, suspected Boko Haram gunmen attacked and burned down a police station in Bulabilin Ngaura village, in the northeast, killing one policeman. Suspected sect members shot dead a traditional ruler in the northeastern Gombe state, as he left a mosque after Friday prayers two days ago. On Thursday, a Briton and an Italian held hostage in Nigeria were killed by their captors after being held for almost a year by what security officials said was a Boko Haram faction, although a spokesman for the sect denied any involvement. Boko Haram used to be confined to Nigeria's northeastern state of Borno. But the sect, or factions of it, have expanded in the past six months to operate in at least 10 states across the north, and have struck the capital.
