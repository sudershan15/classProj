Text:Bill Gates company starts music service for pros
| Reuters
Tue Mar 6, 2012 11:59pm EST * Corbis will license over 1 mln tracks to advertisers * $1,875 for the Monkees' "Daydream Believer" * Gates started firm in 1989 with "Mona Lisa" rights By Ronald Grover LOS ANGELES, March 6 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp co-founder Bill Gates' privately held Corbis, which provides photos and film video for advertisers, is expanding further into entertainment by launching an online music service with songs from the four largest publishers. The GreenLight Music service went live on Wednesday, with more than 1 million tracks from catalogs controlled by Warner Music, EMI Music Publishing, Universal Music and Sony ATV. Corbis , which the Microsoft chairman started in 1989 by securing the digital rights to such art masterpieces as the "Mona Lisa" and "Whistler's Mother", created GreenLight in 2008 and used it to jumpstart efforts to transform itself . Its new music service will let customers license a range of songs for online websites, advertising and other professional uses. Users bid on the tracks, with the labels negotiating the final price. Under Corbis CEO Gary Shenk, the company has been steadily buying and starting entertainment services. In January, it acquired Norm Marshall & Associates, which brokers deals to place clients' products in movies and on TV shows. In February, it launched On Demand Entertainment, a subscription service which allows users to license celebrity photos and other entertainment images. "Our customers want to connect to entertainment to break through the clutter so we decided to give them access to iconic entertainment," said Shenk. In one case, he said, Corbis provided video clips for Hasbro Inc to include in its online version of Trivial Pursuit. The use of the Monkees ' song "Daydream Believer" was recently licensed for $1,875 for a corporate meeting, the company said. "It's our responsibility to find new and innovative ways to help EMI's artists achieve the success they always dreamed of," Brian Monaco, EMI's executive vice-president of sales and strategic management, said in a statement. "And we're committed to finding ways to simply the sync licensing process." Green L ight marks Corbis' tentative foray into the market for online music sales. But Shenk said the company has no plans at the moment to create a service for consumers similar to Apple Inc 's iTunes or Google Inc's music service.

U.S. Judge denies bid to block Delphi buyout by Tokio Marine
| Reuters
March 6 | Tue Mar 6, 2012 11:57pm EST March 6 (Reuters) - A Delaware court on Tuesday denied a request to block the $2.7 billion sale of insurer Delphi Financial Group to Tokio Marine Holdings Inc, brought by pension-fund investors who claim that Delphi's CEO was unjustly enriched by the deal. The suit targeted Delphi, Tokio, and Delphi CEO Robert Rosenkranz, who controls a 49.9 percent voting interest in Delphi and negotiated a non-binding deal for payment of a premium for his shares if the buyout goes through. Although the judge ruled that the deal could proceed, arguing that shareholders should have an opportunity for an up or down vote, he said plaintiffs had a good chance of proving that Rosenkranz was not legally entitled to a premium for his stock even if he feels he is morally entitled to it. "I find it in the best interests of the stockholders that they be given the opportunity to decide for themselves whether the Merger negotiated by Rosenkranz and the Director Defendants offers an acceptable price for their shares," the judge, Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Sam Glasscock III, wrote in his opinion. An attorney for the pension funds which brought the case said he was encouraged, however, by the judge's opinion on the premium paid to Rosenkranz and the prospects for receiving future damages. "We are pleased that the court recognised Mr. Rosenkranz's overreaching," Stuart Grant said in e-mailed statement. Attorneys for Rosenkranz, Delphi and Tokio Marine could not immediately be reached for comment. Tuesday's opinion is one of the first major decisions Glasscock has issued since assuming the vice chancellor position last year. Tokio Marine purchased another U.S. insurer, Philadelphia Insurance Cos, in 2008.

RPT-INSIGHT-Japan missed tsunami wake-up call for change
| Reuters
Tue Mar 6, 2012 11:52pm EST  * Key post-disaster decisions put off, referred to panels * Voter mistrust of politicians rises sharply * But individuals taking decisions, political activism growing By Tomasz Janowski and Linda Sieg TOKYO, March 7 (Reuters) - Three months after Japan's March 11 triple disaster, a long-time expert on the country arrived in Tokyo to research a book he intended to entitle "Rebirth of a Nation." Months later, Richard Samuels is calling his work "The Rhetoric of Crisis." A year after the huge earthquake, deadly tsunami and the world's worst nuclear disaster in a quarter century jolted the country, it is clear that even a shock of such magnitude failed to snap it out of its economic and political torpor. "So far it seems there was more talk of change than change itself. It is all still being sorted out," said Samuels, director of the Center for International Studies at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Japan's mammoth government debt keeps piling up while critical decisions get pushed back, referred to various panels, lodged in elaborate rituals of "consensus-building" or political horse-trading in a gridlocked parliament. Mainstream political parties, torn by conflicting group loyalties, proved incapable of setting aside their differences and providing the leadership for which the public longs.  Instead, politicians reverted to business as usual: parliamentary trench warfare and the annual "ditch the prime minister" exercise that gave Japan its sixth leader in five years and now threatens to block vital tax and welfare reforms. "I personally expected a kind of coalition government just after the earthquake to rescue the economy," says Takahide Kiuchi, chief economist at Nomura Securities. "It never happened and the opposition and the ruling party are still fighting each other. This is my biggest disappointment." That said, Japan has changed over those past 12 months -- though in ways too gradual and unspectacular to grab headlines. The main driving force: growing distrust of politicians and bureaucrats and public indignation at their incompetence. "I think it's all moved Japan on its axis slightly more than before. It has definitely made people less forgiving or believing in Japan Inc, the system," said Pelham Smithers, managing director of a London-based market research firm, who has visited Japan several times since March 11. What remains unclear is whether the anger will force a radical overhaul of Japan's politics, economy and society or deepen public apathy and frustration -- or somewhere in between. So far, there are few signs that Japan's elites will be pushed to implement fundamental change any time soon. The optimistic scenario is that Japan will continue its quiet, slow transformation of the past two decades towards greater accountability of elected officials and its powerful bureaucracy. The most palpable changes are the repercussions of reactor meltdowns at the tsunami-crippled Fukushima power plant.  BECQUERELS AND GEIGERS Not only has ex-premier Naoto Kan, at the helm when the disasters struck, been transformed into a renewable energy apostle, but the whole nation is undergoing a radical rethink. Becquerels and sieverts are part of everyday vocabulary, Geiger counters are household items in parts of the country, saving electricity has become a year-round activity and the myth of clean and safe nuclear energy is dead. "After March 11, I realised that I have lived before without thinking anything about nuclear power," said Kyoko Itagaki, 30, a designer taking part in an anti-nuclear rally in Tokyo last month. "Now, the more I look into that, the more I realise how dangerous nuclear power plants are ... It's a sin not to care," she added. "My life has changed a lot. I now buy water and vegetables from certain places and have a Geiger counter." Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda has admitted that the government, bureaucracy, utilities and experts share the blame for being blinded by the myth of nuclear safety. Power utilities and the government are now paying the price, so far unable to persuade a single community to approve restarts of reactors taken off line since the disaster, meaning all of Japan's 54 reactors may be shut by summer. The government is trying to win back the trust of those communities, many of which have relied on nuclear plant-related income, by launching computer simulated "stress tests" and creating more independent oversight of the industry. Noda, while not as blunt as his predecessor Kan, also admits that Japan will have to cut its dependence on nuclear power, though the government is likely to settle for a long gradual process when it formulates a new energy policy this summer. Fukushima operator Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) and other regional monopoly utilities that for decades enjoyed a symbiotic relationship with industry and politicians are beginning to feel the heat from the public and big customers. "I think it is clear that this has been a trigger for the start of possible reform of that dark side of the system," says Tatsuo Hatta, an economist, who is on an expert panel discussing Japan's energy mix. "The myth that nuclear power was completely safe and that what utilities said was completely correct has been utterly destroyed." Tepco's plan to hike electricity tariffs provoked an unprecedented attack from Japanese carmakers and steelmakers and several local municipalities have been trying to break its regional monopoly seeking competitive bids from its rivals. Clearly, disillusion with Japan's establishment has reached new depths since the disasters. When the Democratic Party of Japan swept to power in 2009, ending more than half a century of nearly uninterrupted rule by its conservative rival, the Liberal Democrats, it did so largely by promising to pay more heed to ordinary people while prying power from the bureaucracy and vested interests. But the Fukushima disaster showed how the collusion between regulators, the bureaucracy and utilities persisted, giving the public a sense that it was let down by the entire system. Opinion polls underscore the lack of voter trust in mainstream parties, which are showing visible alarm over a potential challenge from a 42-year-old mayor of the western city of Osaka, who advocates strong executive power. On the flip side of sagging trust in officialdom, however, are signs that individuals and businesses are taking the initiative instead of relying on paternalistic bureaucrats. For example, Aeon Co., Japan's top supermarket chain has responded to public radiation fears with tougher standards than the official norms. In November, it took a step further and said it would not sell any food items that contained radiation. "Consumers are demanding, so by having demanding standards I believe we are protecting producers," said Yasuhide Chikazawa, the chain's executive in charge of food safety. Many private corporations responded quickly to the tsunami and have since collected donations and mobilised volunteers to help devastated communities.  NEW CHANNELS The perceived lack of timely and full information about radiation risks from officials and mainstream media has also given rise to an array of social media initiatives. "Critical new media have highlighted the shortcomings in the mass media's reporting on the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear crisis and attempted to fill the significant information gap they left," said Nicola Liscutin, a visiting research fellow at University of Tokyo. One example is Web Iwakami, a service run by freelance journalist Yasumi Iwakami, who uses as many as 93 live streaming channels to report on anti-nuclear events across the country, alerting his 80,000 Twitter followers to the broadcasts. That may not seem much in a country of 127 million, but for Japan, where protests used to attract only hard-core activists, the reach and scope add a new dimension. "The nation-wide spread of these protests and their demographics are remarkable: from seasoned demonstrators to the many who confessed that this was their very first protest action; from families bringing their toddlers and children, to teenagers, students ...and pensioners," Liscutin said. Matsumoto Hajime, 37, one of the organisers of major anti-nuclear rallies, says the Japanese have rediscovered politics. "Japan has become more normal. Many young people started talking about government policies that directly affect them -- previously that was almost completely unheard of," he said in his recycling shop full of old furniture, radios and clocks in Tokyo's central Koenji neighbourhood. Yet even hard-core activists worry protests may have peaked. They hope the protests have sown the seeds of a lasting transformation that will help Japan break out of its doldrums, but fear the energy will fizzle and the public become resigned. Akiko Murakami, a mother of two schoolboys and one of the founding members of a grass-roots parent group in Fukushima dealing with radiation risks, may have best summed up those hopes and fears. "Japanese are very good at forgetting and forgiving, which can be good in some ways, but in a situation like this, I think we should not forget and learn to think and act for ourselves, don't leave everything to the government," she said.

Oklahoma state senate passes heartbeat abortion bill

The Heartbeat Informed Consent Act was passed by a 34-8 vote and will go to the Oklahoma House, where pro-life Republicans outnumber Democrats by a 2-1 margin. The original version of the bill had required a woman to hear the fetal heartbeat before an abortion. But the author, Republican Senator Dan Newberry of Tulsa, amended the measure to require only that an abortion provider inform a patient of her right to hear the heartbeat. Even so, Newberry said the proposed law is important to further "a culture of life" in Oklahoma. The heartbeat is the only way for a fetus to communicate that it wants to live, Newberry said. "It can't say please don't kill me, it can't say I want to live. It can't say anything," he said. Martha Skeeters, president of the Oklahoma Coalition for Reproductive Justice, said the bill was another example of state lawmakers placing barriers before women who want to end a pregnancy. "They're trying to shame or humiliate women who exercise their constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy," she said. The bill is the second anti-abortion measure approved by the Oklahoma Senate this year. Senators last month approved the "Personhood Act," which decrees that a fertilized human egg is a person. The Oklahoma House has not voted on the bill but proponents predict it will pass. A pro-life organization called Personhood Oklahoma is gathering signatures to force an election to amend the state constitution to define a person as any human "from the beginning of the biological development of that human being to natural death." The petition notes that the killing of any person is prohibited without due process of law. About 155,000 signatures are needed to put the issue on the November ballot, according to Personhood Oklahoma. A similar ballot initiative in Mississippi was defeated by voters last year.

Sim City gets rebuilt for 2013 with modern look

Baker SAN FRANCISCO | Tue Mar 6, 2012 11:50pm EST SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - "Sim City" is going back to its roots. The classic city building game that first came out in 1989, is returning next year in a new version that has a modern-day look and feel but is being built by those who worked on the original. Lucy Bradshaw, senior vice president of gamemaker Electronic Arts' Maxis Label which was behind the hits "Sim City 2000" and "Sim City 3000," said both purists and newcomers should enjoy the upcoming game that she described as the most realistic "Sim City" title yet. The studio has not put out a Sims game since "Sim City 4" in 2004, but Bradshaw said EA had been considering reinventing the game for years. The new PC game will be out sometime in 2013. "Anytime we'd release any Sims game, the first comment from fans on the Internet would be 'please make Sim City,' she said. The new game, which was unveiled at this week's Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, will be brought up to current-day speed with environmental issues affecting construction and mayors dealing with climate change, renewable energy and natural disasters as they build their cities. Davis Guggenheim, director of climate change documentary "An Inconvenient Truth," told the conference audience he had seen an early version of the game, and he believes it can teach young players to come up with solutions to real-world problems. Decisions as a city builder can have pronounced effects on Sim City residents. If a player chooses to make a town economically reliant on coal mining, for example, the city will have to invest in building hospitals to keep residents from getting sick and fleeing. "The choices that you make will affect the lives of the Sims who are there," Bradshaw said, "and you might start to see some residents protesting at City Hall." What happens in one city can also affect a friend's town. The game will have online features where one person can play side by side with friends who are mayors of their own cities. All players globally can compete in rankings to be the greenest, the dirtiest, the fittest, or the best city in which to live. Even though it's been years since the last "Sim City" game, the market for building games has not gone away. Zynga's "CityVille" game on Facebook has shown that millions of people want to control their own towns and work with their friends at the same time. When asked about "CityVille," Bradshaw said the new simulation technology powering the game called "GlassBox," which EA is showing off this week at its developer conference, is in a league of its own. "We invented the genre and it's so far ahead of any city builder game I've ever seen," she said. While "Sim City" tackles urban planning issues, Bradshaw said the team made sure to design twists that players won't find in any textbook. "While it is about managing your resources correctly, a giant lizard may troll around the corner and take out a few buildings and you'll have to deal with that."
