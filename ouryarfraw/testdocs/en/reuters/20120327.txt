A summit of the West African ECOWAS bloc agreed to send a team of heads of state to confront the putschists in the next 48 hours, a sign of the region's growing resolve to end the instability that has dogged it for decades. "Dialogue and concertation will be our primary instruments in the search for a solution but we shall not hesitate to use any other option dictated by circumstances," said Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara, who won a 2010 election but only came to power after a four-month civil war. "The summit authorizes preparations for a force under stand-by for ECOWAS to deal with any eventuality," a closing summit statement said, which also threatened possible travel bans and financial and diplomatic sanctions on junta members. The statement did not any include indications of possible army action on the ground and ECOWAS - which does not have its own standing army - would have to go through potentially lengthy processes to raise sufficient troops from member states. The one-day meeting in the Ivorian economic hub Abidjan suspended Mali from all decision-making bodies of the ECOWAS bloc in a widely expected diplomatic gesture to isolate soldiers behind last Wednesday's coup. Current ECOWAS head Ouattara plus five other leaders - Nigeria's Goodluck Jonathan, Burkina Faso's Blaise Compaore, Liberia's Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, Niger's Mahamadou Issoufou and Benin's Yayi Boni - will travel to Mali to seek "the re-establishment of constitutional order", a statement said. Aside from Ouattara, a former top IMF official, the delegation has in Johnson-Sirleaf a Nobel Peace laureate, in Issoufou one of Washington's new regional favorites, and in Compaore, a former coup leader turned regional power broker. Nigeria is the regional military and economic power Earlier, the French Foreign Ministry said its ambassador in Mali had been in contact with Malian President Amadou Toumani Toure, who gave reassurances he was safe. Toure's whereabouts are unknown since he fled his palace on Wednesday last week. "COUP ERA OVER"? Mostly mid-ranking soldiers ousted Toure last Wednesday after a mutiny sparked by soaring frustration in the army over his handling of a Tuareg rebellion in the desert north, where the military has faced a series of setbacks. The army has complained it lacks the supplies and equipment needed to beat back the rebels, who have been reinforced by fighters and weapons from Libya's war. The ECOWAS move is the latest sign of mounting domestic and international pressure to reverse a coup in Africa's third largest gold miner, a country which was one of the most stable democracies of the region. One ECOWAS source said leaders could in future also apply travel bans, asset freezes and other measures specifically targeting the coup leaders as individuals. "We want them to see that the age of coups is over and this has to be put back in the box," one diplomat in the region said. "We want to target the people who are responsible for this, punish them and still not hurt the average Malian." Travel bans and asset freezes on specific individuals were used last year in Ivory Coast to put pressure on former leader Laurent Gbagbo to quit after he lost the 2010 election. Gbagbo was ousted with U.N. and French military help in April 2011. Mali's neighbors could also make it difficult for the junta to get funds to pay salaries and other financial obligations by restricting its access to the BCEAO central bank that controls the money supply in the West African franc zone, another tactic used against Gbagbo. "The question over how they will pay the salaries at the end of the month will be key as there is no minister of finance and the secretary general, who is now running the ministry, won't have the authorized signature with central bank," a Bamako-based diplomat said, requesting not to be named.

Abu Dhabi royals involved in RBS talks: sources
| Reuters
TOKYO - Shares, gold and oil fell and the euro remained pressured on Wednesday as Greece struggled to form a government two days after an election, heightening the risk that a hard-won bailout deal could be scrapped. | Video WASHINGTON - Hiring by small businesses slowed in April, but there was an increase in the number of employers planning to create new jobs and those reporting they could not find qualified workers to fill job openings. BEIJING/HONG KONG - China reiterated its opposition on Thursday to a European Union plan to limit airline carbon dioxide emissions and called for talks to resolve the issue a day after its major airlines refused to pay any carbon costs under the new law.

Credit: Reuters/Suzanne Plunkett By Stanley Carvalho and Mirna Sleiman ABU DHABI/DUBAI | Tue Mar 27, 2012 11:53pm EDT ABU DHABI/DUBAI (Reuters) - Talks to sell a stake in Britain's state-owned Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) are being held at the level of the Abu Dhabi ruling family, sources told Reuters. A source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday that Amanda Staveley, a businesswoman notable for her Middle Eastern connections, was advising the emirate's rulers. "The talks have been going on for six months, and nothing is likely to materialize for the next few months," the source said, adding that Abu Dhabi could end up with a stake of more than a third, though it has not decided which of its entities would hold the stake. Staveley played a prominent role in Abu Dhabi royal Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahayan's 2008 investment in another British bank, Barclays (BARC.L). The Financial Times reported on Wednesday that Abu Dhabi investors had discussed a 10 billion pound ($16 billion) investment in RBS. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ A senior banker told Reuters on Tuesday that the oil-rich emirate's sovereign wealth funds were not involved in talks at this stage. "It's happening higher up," the banker said, adding that a deal could fall apart on price grounds. Two other banking sources also said that a deal, if it happened, would be struck at a government-to-government level. "Abu Dhabi is always talking to parties to invest, including RBS. Whether it will materialize or not is too early to say," a source close to the royal family said on condition of anonymity. A stake buy by Abu Dhabi would be the first move on a large financial asset by Gulf investors since the 2008 financial crisis, when regional royals and sovereign funds bought into Citigroup (C.N), Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) and Barclays. An Abu Dhabi government official declined to comment. Shares in RBS, in which the British government took an 83 percent stake in 2008, closed at 28.67 pence on Tuesday. The senior banker said he did not expect a stake to be sold at a price higher than the market level. A deal at that price would leave British taxpayers nursing billions of pounds of losses, given the average price of 49.9 pence the government paid for its stake. "During the whole euro crisis, it's been interesting to see how the Gulf sovereign wealth funds have generally stayed away from making a move. Maybe now that things have settled down a little, there could be a shift in that thinking," said David Butter, an independent Middle East analyst. The FT cited people close to the discussions as saying talks have taken place over the course of the last three years into a potential investment in RBS and Britain's other big part-nationalized banks, Lloyds (LLOY.L). Abu Dhabi investors could invest up to 5 billion pounds in RBS stock -- potentially equivalent to a 14 percent equity stake, the FT said. The remainder would be injected as contingent capital. Neither RBS nor Lloyd's could be reached immediately for comment. STRONG TIES Gulf investors have historically had a penchant for British assets, piling into London real estate and buying up trophy assets such as the Harrods department store. "There's a long-standing strategic relationship between Britain and Abu Dhabi, and they come to Abu Dhabi because of that," said Mohammed Ali Yasin, an Abu Dhabi-based market analyst. "If this deal does go through, it would be more about Abu Dhabi helping the UK, rather than a plan to invest in the banks in Europe or Britain." Some of these investments have paid off handsomely. Abu Dhabi made about 3 billion pounds after investing in Barclays during the financial crisis, in a complex deal that helped the bank avoid a state bailout. "If they can turn their investment in RBS into anything like the returns they had on their Barclays shareholding, they will do very well out of it, which in turn should be to the benefit of the wider British economy," said Simon Denham, chief executive of spread-betters Capital Spreads. Its investment in Citigroup (C.N), however, remains a sore point. The emirate's main sovereign wealth fund went to an arbitration panel to get the deal scrapped or get paid more than $4 billion in damages. The panel ruled against it, a decision it has appealed against. RBS CEO Stephen Hester is three years into a five-year turnaround plan that he has dubbed the biggest-ever bank restructuring. RBS lost 2 billion pounds last year, its fourth straight annual loss, pushing back the time it is expected to deliver returns for investors. That renewed calls for Britain to consider kick-starting the sale of the stake at a loss to cut growing political interference - mostly on lending and pay - and boost the appeal of the bank for private investors. "We will start returning the stake to the private sector when it offers value for money to the taxpayer," a British Treasury official told the Financial Times on Monday. "The share price is not near that now." Britain also holds a 41-percent stake in Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L). It is sitting on a 10 billion pound loss on that 20 billion pound rescue.

Bank of America plans international advisory board: sources
| Reuters
Bank of America Corp Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan looks on during the Charlotte Chamber's Economic Outlook Conference in Charlotte, North Carolina December 19, 2011. Credit: Reuters/Chris Keane By Rick Rothacker Charlotte, North Carolina | Tue Mar 27, 2012 11:50pm EDT Charlotte, North Carolina (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) is looking to create an international advisory board that could help steer chief executive officer Brian Moynihan's overseas strategy, according to sources familiar with the matter. The panel, which is in an early stage of development, would be similar to the international council at JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), the sources said. That group is led by former British prime minister, Tony Blair. In the past two years, Moynihan has shed investments in foreign banks such as China Construction Bank Corp (0939.HK) (601939.SS), to build capital, even as the second largest U.S. bank has continued to expand international corporate banking and capital markets operations. Unlike predecessor Ken Lewis, Moynihan has made a point of attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in his first two years as CEO of the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank. Bank of America's non-U.S. revenue climbed to $19.6 billion in 2011, up from $15.1 billion a year earlier, but overseas income still only comprised about 21 percent of the company's total, according to the bank's annual report. The bank's European operations suffered a blow last week when former Merrill Lynch dealmaker Andrea Orcel departed for a post at Swiss bank UBS (UBSN.VX). The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday reported that Bank of America's advisory panel could have 10 to 15 members with backgrounds ranging from politics to securities regulation. The Journal also reported on Tuesday that the bank is conducting a search for several new members for its corporate board of directors. Five of the bank's 13 directors are at least 70 or will turn 70 this year, the Journal said. As recently as its 2010 proxy filing, the bank has said it is a "general policy" of the board not to nominate directors for re-election if they have reached the age of 72, although it can do so if it is in the "best interest" of shareholders. The 2011 proxy did not address the topic. Director Virgis Colbert is 72, but the bank has asked him to remain on the board, the Journal reported. The bank is expected to file its 2012 proxy filing as early as this week, which will include the slate of directors to be voted on at the May 9 annual shareholder meeting.

STOCKS NEWS SINGAPORE-Citi downgrades Wilmar to hold
| Reuters
Tue Mar 27, 2012 11:45pm EDT Citigroup reduced its rating on Singapore palm oil firm Wilmar International Ltd to hold from buy and cut its target price to S$5.30 from S$6.10. Wilmar shares were down 1 percent at S$4.97. The shares are flat so far this year, underperforming a 14 percent rise in the broader market. Citigroup said the company's second half of 2011 was a disappointment as it had weak margin trends at both its oilseeds and palm merchandizing units due to heightened volatility. While market normalization will help Wilmar's margins recover in these two segments in 2012 fiscal year, the pace of recovery this year will be muted as Wilmar did not record sharply reduced inventory and receivables in the second half of 2011, Citi said in a report. "While execution on expansion plans in Indonesia may be slow for new entrants, there is now potential that more competitors (both existing and new) may be encouraged to set up facilities." 1140 (0340 GMT) (Reporting by Eveline Danubrata in Singapore; eveline.danubrata.thomsonreuters.com)  ************************************************************  10:19 STOCK NEWS SINGAPORE-Otto Marine falls after rights issue Shares of Singapore's Otto Marine Ltd declined as much as 11.1 percent after the offshore marine firm proposed a rights issue to raise around S$75.6 million ($60 million).

(L-R) Mexican Defense Secretary Guillermo Galvan Galvan, Canadian Defense Minister Peter Mackay and U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta address a news conference after a trilateral meeting in Ottawa March 27, 2012. Credit: Reuters/Patrick Doyle By David Alexander OTTAWA | Tue Mar 27, 2012 11:37pm EDT OTTAWA (Reuters) - North America's three defense ministers declared their first-ever dialogue on common security threats on Tuesday an "historic occasion," even though their main accomplishment was to agree to continue regular discussions. Canadian Defense Minister Peter MacKay, who hosted the gathering in Ottawa, said he and his counterparts from Mexico and the United States decided to develop a common assessment of threats facing the continent and to cooperate to address them. Key among the common security concerns are illegal drug trafficking, organized crime, disaster response and cyber security - a growing concern in a region where officials say critical infrastructure like electrical grids often do not stop at the borders. "Through our discussions today we were able to identify a number of opportunities to better coordinate our efforts on issues related to national defense," MacKay told a news conference. "We discussed the need to advance a common understanding of the threats facing North America," he added. "We will work together to develop a trilateral threat assessment for the continent that will provide the basis for common understanding and approach as we work to address these challenges." U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said the gathering had provided an "unprecedented opportunity to try to bring together our nations in a common approach to continental security." "All of us have been part of what I think has been a very historic occasion," he told a news conference. "This is the first trilateral meeting of defense ministers from the United States, Canada and Mexico." Panetta and MacKay held bilateral talks with each other and also with Mexico's defense and navy secretaries, General Guillermo Galvan Galvan and Admiral Francisco Saynaz Mendoza, before all the ministers met together. "For Mexico," Galvan told the news conference, "fighting organized crime and narco-trafficking represents our highest priority." More than 50,000 people have been killed in clashes between drug cartels and Mexico's government over the past five years. Panetta said he and his Mexican counterparts had "a great discussion about the effort against the cartels and how we can continue to improve our efforts against them." He said they also discussed improving the military response to disaster relief, as well as military training and exchange programs. Senior U.S. defense officials, speaking ahead of the meeting, said they thought its main accomplishment would be to agree to institutionalize the forum as a way to address hemispheric security issues. Once accomplished, they said, the three sides could begin developing a common assessment of the threats they agree on. "What I'm hoping to do is to establish with them a format, a forum here where we can have regular sessions that focus on an agenda and we do this on a regular basis," Panetta told reporters ahead of the meeting.

China Dev Bank 3-yr bond yield at middle end of forecast
