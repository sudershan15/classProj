Log In By Benjamin Pimentel, MarketWatch SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — Patti Hart, the Yahoo Inc. board member who chaired the committee that led to the hiring of Chief Executive Scott Thompson, is stepping down, AllThingsD reported Tuesday, citing unnamed sources. In a related development, Yahoo’s /quotes/zigman/59898/quotes/nls/yhoo YHOO +0.07%  board announced that it has created a special committee to look into Thompson’s academic credentials, “as well as the facts and circumstances related to the review and disclosure of those credentials in connection with Thompson’s appointment as CEO,” the company said in a statement.

(Photo: Reuters) The Web portal’s statement did not address the report on Hart’s departure. Representatives of the company did not immediately respond to questions on the report. Hart will not seek re-election in the next annual meeting, AllThingsD said. She had been criticized by shareholder activist Daniel Loeb, chief of the investment group Third Point, for her role in the selection of Thompson. Third Point is waging a proxy war against the Yahoo board. Last week, Third Point went public with a clam that Thompson had misstated his credentials in stating he had a computer-science degree. Yahoo has called the mistake an error, but Loeb has asked the company to dismiss Thompson. Read more about the pressure building on Yahoo regarding its CEO’s credentials.
