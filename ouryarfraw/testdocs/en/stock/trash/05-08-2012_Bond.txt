Log In By Deborah Levine, MarketWatch NEW YORK (MarketWatch) — Treasury prices rose on Tuesday, pushing some benchmark yields down for a fifth session, as political uncertainty in Greece increased the appeal of the relative safety of U.S. bonds and supported the government’s first of three major auctions this week. Yields on 10-year notes /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed 10_YEAR -1.54% , which move inversely to prices, fell 4 basis points to 1.83%, their lowest level since early February. A basis point is one one-hundredth of a percentage point. Yields on 5-year notes /quotes/zigman/4868109/delayed 5_YEAR -1.28%  declined 2 basis points to 0.76%, the fifth daily decline and the lowest level seen in three months. Click to Play Can leaders reconcile differences? The world will be watching closely when French President-elect François Hollande meets with German Chancellor Angela Merkel for early clues of how willing the two leaders are to reconcile their differences. (Photo: AP.) Thirty-year-bond yields /quotes/zigman/4868063/delayed 30_YEAR -0.69%  fell 4 basis points to 3.02%, extending a four-day slide. Bonds stayed up after the Treasury Department sold $32 billion in 3-year notes /quotes/zigman/4868286/delayed 3_YEAR -2.15% at a yield of 0.362%, the lowest level since February. The all-time low was 0.334%, set in September 2011. “Continued negative headlines from Greece gave a solid bid to U.S. Treasurys and kept investors interested in 3-year notes,” said George Goncalves, head of U.S. rates strategy at Nomura Securities. Bidders offered to buy 3.65 times the amount of debt sold, above the average of 3.46 times at the last four monthly auctions of the securities, according to CRT Capital Group. See Treasury auction results. Indirect bidders, a group which includes foreign central banks, purchased 35.7%, compared to 35.2% on average. Direct bidders, a group which includes domestic money managers, purchased another 11.2%, the highest since November and well above the average of 7.6%. The direct bidder demand “is a sign that real money buyers may be starting to accept the low yield levels as the euro-zone crisis shows no sign of abating,” Goncalves said. A higher proportion of each auction going to direct and indirect bidders is considered good for the market and Treasury, because those buyers tend to hold on to new securities longer. /quotes/zigman/4868286/delayed 3_YEAR 0.36, -0.0080, -2.15% Three-year yields Alternatively, the bulk of remaining bonds are sold to primary dealers – banks that tend to turn around and resell new securities into the market, pressuring prices lower. The auction is the first of three this week as part of the government’s quarterly refunding. It will issue 10-year notes on Wednesday, followed by 30-year bonds on Thursday. Both may come at the lowest yields on record. New elections in Greece? Greece’s conservative, pro-bailout New Democracy party late Monday failed to form a coalition government in the wake of Sunday’s parliamentary elections. Analysts said prospects for any party to form a government after the fractious results remained slim, leaving the door open to a return to the polls as early as June. See more on Greek coalition. “This time we have worries about a Greek default [...] There’s an impending bond maturity that’s gotten people agitated,” David Ader and Ian Lyngen, bond strategists at CRT, wrote in emailed comments. That’s also tied up with whether Greece will negotiate the next tranche of its international bailout package. Treasurys have gained in recent days as political upheaval in Greece and France, and local elections in Germany, indicate waning support for the kind of austerity measures that have been deemed necessary to resolve the long-running debt crisis.

At the same time, U.S. economic reports have come in soft to mixed, including a disappointing report on Friday showing the labor market grew more slowly in April, which also makes Treasury bonds more attractive. /quotes/zigman/4868283/delayed Add to portfolio 10_YEAR 10 Year Treasury Note US : ICAP Sovereign Debt 1.85 -0.03 -1.54% Volume: 0.00 May 8, 2012 4:03p /quotes/zigman/4868109/delayed Add to portfolio 5_YEAR 5 Year Treasury Note US : ICAP Sovereign Debt 0.77 -0.01 -1.28% Volume: 0.00 May 8, 2012 4:04p /quotes/zigman/4868063/delayed Add to portfolio 30_YEAR 30 Year Treasury Bond US : ICAP Sovereign Debt 3.04 -0.02 -0.69% Volume: 0.00 May 8, 2012 4:04p /quotes/zigman/4868286/delayed Add to portfolio 3_YEAR 3 Year Treasury Note US : ICAP Sovereign Debt 0.36 -0.0080 -2.15% Volume: 0.00 May 8, 2012 4:02p Deborah Levine is a MarketWatch reporter, based in New York.
