Log In By Rex Crum, MarketWatch SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — AOL Inc. earnings report on Wednesday morning may or may not give CEO Tim Armstrong the extra ammunition needed to fend off an attack that’s set to come at the Internet media company’s annual meeting next month. AOL /quotes/zigman/577531/quotes/nls/aol AOL +3.15%  is scheduled to deliver its first-quarter earnings report before the stock market opens on Wednesday. Reuters AOL chairman and CEO Tim Armstrong. Analysts surveyed by FactSet Research currently estimate AOL will earn 18 cents a share on $512.8 million in revenue for the quarter, compared with a profit of 4 cents a share on sales of $551.4 million in the same period a year ago. Several of those analysts who follow AOL say that, for the most part, they are expecting a solid report from the company. “We have grown more positive on AOL in light of two consecutive solid quarters, and the recent successful monetization of a large part of its IP [intellectual property],” wrote Barclays analyst Anthony DiClemente in a note to clients. DiClemente has an equal weight, or neutral rating, and $27-a-share target price on AOL’s stock. That “successful monetization” that DiClemente referred to is AOL’s April 9 deal to sell more than 800 patents to Microsoft Corp. /quotes/zigman/20493/quotes/nls/msft MSFT -0.49%  for $1.06 billion. The positive reaction to that deal accounted for the lion’s share of what has been a rise in AOL’s stock price of more than 62% this year, to $24.65.

The dissident investment fund Starboard Value and its CEO, Jeffrey Smith, has launched a proxy fight against AOL in an effort to try to gain three seats on the AOL board of directors. In February, Starboard, which owns about 5.3% of AOL’s outstanding stock, sent a letter to AOL’s board, with an initial list of five board nominees, and on April 10, the fund declared that even the patent sale to Microsoft wasn’t enough, and that it would proceed with its proxy fight. Read more about Starboard and its issues with AOL. AOL’s annual shareholders’ meeting is scheduled for June 14. Among the issues Starboard has with AOL is what the fund said is a “display business [that] is currently losing over $500 million per year,” including $150 million in losses from AOL’s Patch network of local news and information sites. AOL fired back at Starboard on May 2. In a letter to shareholders, CEO Armstrong called upon the company’s shareholders to reject Starboard’s claims over matters such as its so-called “display business.” Read more about AOL's counterattack against Starboard. Click to Play Yahoo director Hart to step down AllThingsD's Kara Swisher reports that Patti Hart, the Yahoo director in charge of the search that resulted in the hiring of Scott Thompson as its CEO, will not seek election at the next annual meeting. “In fact, AOL has no “display business” segment and Starboard’s creation of a profit/loss figure for the so-called “display business” is a fiction, which we believe is designed to mislead AOL’s stockholders concerning the value of AOL’s content-based assets,” Armstrong said, in his shareholder letter. Peter Stabler, of Wells Fargo Securities, said that, semantics aside, when AOL reports its results Wednesday morning, he expects the focus to remain on “display [advertising] trends, Patch operating metrics and capital allocation given [a] large cash balance derived from the Microsoft patent sale.” Stabler, who has an outperform rating on AOL’s stock, wrote in a note that he expects display-ad sales to rise 12% from a year ago for the company. However, he said that AOL is likely to record more market share loss due to the impact of social networks, in particular. And for AOL to maintain its recent good standing with investors, Stabler said the company needs to show progress with its rich-media advertising efforts and video offerings “if AOL is going to convince the Street that [its] display strategy is capable of returning the company to market-level growth.” /quotes/zigman/577531 /quotes/nls/aol Add to portfolio AOL AOL Inc.
