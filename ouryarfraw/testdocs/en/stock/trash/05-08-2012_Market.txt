Log In By Deborah Levine, MarketWatch NEW YORK (MarketWatch) — The Australian dollar fell to its lowest level since December on Tuesday, breaching $1.01, weighed down by domestic trade data and global worries about European debt. The Australian dollar /quotes/zigman/4867876/sampled AUDUSD -0.8006%  retreated for a seventh day to $1.0126, from $1.0207 in late North American trading on Monday. /quotes/zigman/4867876/sampled AUDUSD 1.0116, -0.0082, -0.8006% Aussie vs. U.S. dollar The Aussie fell as low as $1.0087. It hasn’t closed under $1.01 since Dec. 21, according to FactSet Research. Data out Tuesday showed that Australia posted a wider-than-expected trade deficit for March of 1.59 billion Australian dollars, up from A$754 million in February. That followed the Reserve Bank of Australia’s recent slashing of interest rates to boost growth and inflation, which will depend on commodity exports, tying its fortune to the global economy and China’s in particular. The trade deficit indicates that “the RBA easing recently may not be done,” said Eric Viloria, senior currency strategist at Forex.com. Investors’ appetite for riskier assets like stocks and commodities faded as the European trading session began, weighing on interest in the Aussie dollar. The inability of political parties in Greece to form a government has raised questions about the nation’s commitment to its agreement with international lenders. That has in turn raised uncertainty in the minds of investors about the ability of Europe to control its sovereign-debt crisis. The U.S. dollar also rose against the euro /quotes/zigman/4867933/sampled EURUSD -0.3248%  and extended its winning streak against a basket of currencies to the longest since the beginning of the U.S. credit crisis in 2008.

The Aussie dollar’s reaction to the trade data was somewhat subdued, and “one conclusion may be that global macro developments and broad swings in risk appetite remain more important to investor decision-making than developments in Australia,” said Todd Elmer, a currency strategist at Citigroup. “Another conclusion is that weaker Australian data flow may be better anticipated at this stage.” Also, Australia’s government unveiled sharp cuts in its 2012-13 budget.

It’s hasn’t traded under parity – when one Australian dollar buys one U.S. unit – since mid-December. The Aussie dollar was weaker than $1 for most of the past decade. The Australian dollar is likely to move below parity again, Viloria said.
