They have excuse - natural gas price is low. they want to eat all puts and make short covering. I have seen that with DIS and BA. bmoca  •  3 months ago Why chemicals every day? Why not any of a thousand other industries? Heart  •  5 months ago Yes the time has come, finally I'm revealing my secret for trading the Gold market, a secret that will allow you to know which direction Gold is going to go with up to a 90% accuracy rate, thus allowing you to make anywhere from $200 to $5,000 per day, and that's no exaggeration! How is this possible? Google “Gold Trading Academy” to learn more. Terry Rice 5 months ago Trying to drum up a little business commission huh? IF anybody could predict the price of any one commodity or any single stock, @ a 90% accuracy rate they would not be posting replies on Yahoo! Warren Buffett will hire you for an 8 figure salary today if you can predict anything with a 55% accuracy. Jim Cramer would also give you his Mad Money program and another 7 figure salary for that same 55% accuracy rate. NOW, Goldman would put you in their corner office and you could run the company for a 60% accuracy rate. So I think you are missing the boat with your 90% accuracy rate by posting comments for free here. Rackey 8 hours ago Because we, everyone of us, use chemicals EVERY DAY!
