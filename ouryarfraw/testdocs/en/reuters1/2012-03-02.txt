Egyptian authorities had accused the workers, including the son of U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, of working for groups receiving illegal foreign funding and had barred them from leaving the country. The case put at risk $1.3 billion in annual U.S. military aid to Egypt, a cash transfer that began flowing after Egypt made peace with Israel in 1979, and it marked the deepest rift in U.S.-Egyptian relations in decades. The travel ban was lifted this week and the U.S. State Department on Friday said 13 foreign workers -- six of them U.S. citizens -- had left Egypt on a private plane. The amount of bail paid for the U.S. citizens was set at about $330,000 each. LaHood and three other activists from the International Republican Institute (IRI) arrived in the United States on Friday evening, a representative of the organization said. Out of a total of 43 foreign and Egyptian workers who have been charged in the case, 16 were U.S. citizens and seven of those were in Egypt and had been subject to the travel ban. One of the seven chose to remain in Egypt, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters. The State Department declined to name the people, some of whom worked for the IRI and the National Democratic Institute, U.S.-funded nongovernmental organizations that seek to promote democracy abroad. Nuland said the money to pay the bail ultimately came from the U.S. government, saying that the Obama administration had agreed to treat the legal expenses stemming from the incident "as part of the activities that the U.S. government funds." "The NGOs paid the bail out of money that they received from the U.S. government," she said. "We agreed to this because the situation arose in the context of the democracy promotion work that they were doing that we had funded and supported." Nuland said that it was up to the U.S. citizens who had left to decide whether to return to Egypt to face the charges. She was unable to say whether the money would be forfeited to the Egyptian government if they did not, or whether the money would be returned to the NGOs or to the U.S. government if they return to stand trial. "Our hope and expectation is that we can get this case dismissed," she said, saying that if it was dismissed the questions about the bail would "presumably" be resolved.

Fed's Bullard: U.S. economic outlook is brighter

See the best of Reuters photography.  See more | Photo caption  A look at the legal battles and the controversies over gay marriage.  Slideshow  Peru declares a health alert after hundreds of birds and dolphins wash up dead in the past few months.  Slideshow  By Peter Kennedy VANCOUVER | Fri Mar 2, 2012 11:45pm EST VANCOUVER (Reuters) - St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said on Friday the U.S. economic outlook is brighter and household confidence has improved, suggesting he sees no need for further steps to ease financial conditions. "I think the data is coming stronger on the U.S. economy. I think it's a good time to wait and see and gather more data, get a better read on what's going on in Europe, and see what is going to happen next," he told reporters after a speech at Simon Fraser University. Bond buying would be a potent tool, and it would have important effects on the economy, Bullard said. "But we already have a lot of things on the table," he said. However, Bullard said he would have reservations about any further Fed bond buying because it could accelerate an already sharp recent climb in energy prices. Some Fed officials believe high unemployment and sluggish growth demand another round of quantitative easing to kick the recovery into higher gear, while others, including Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, have suggested renewed bond buying remains an option should the recovery lose steam. "I would be concerned that we not undertake a policy move like QE that would possibly feed into a global increase in oil prices," he told reporters after a speech at Simon Fraser University. After the Fed announced its second round of quantitative easing in November 2010, commodity prices around the world rose, in part because as the dollar's value fell, other assets rose in price. SEES U.S. JOBLESS RATE FALLING Bernanke told Congress this week there are reasons to question whether recent steep declines in the unemployment rate, which has tumbled from 9.1 percent in August to 8.3 percent in January, will continue because growth is slow and incomes have increased only modestly. But Bullard said he expects unemployment to continue to edge lower, and sees no inconsistency with modest growth and steady labor market gains. "I think unemployment will continue to get better," he said, in response to questions after a speech at Simon Fraser University. "I don't really have in my mind the idea that you've got to get the rapid growth in order to get the unemployment rate to come down." Bullard, who is not a voter on the Fed's policy-setting panel this year, said he expects unemployment to decline to 7.8 percent by the end of the year. A WARNING ON HOUSING While Bullard has in the past been seen as a centrist among Fed policymakers, he favors raising benchmark overnight rates in 2013, earlier than the consensus view that tightening will happen in late 2014. The Fed cut rates to near zero in December 2008, and it has bought $2.3 trillion in bonds to stimulate growth. At its January meeting, the Fed said the sluggish pace of growth and a high unemployment rate suggest the central bank won't begin to raise rates until almost three years from now. The Fed's next meeting is March 13. At that meeting, officials will have to weigh signs that the recovery is exceeding expectations against worries that rising oil prices will deal another setback to growth. Bullard warned against trying to prop up struggling housing markets. Several Fed officials have said taking steps to prevent home foreclosures and clear a backlog of unsold homes could stimulate faster growth. "It is not feasible or desirable to attempt to re-inflate the bubble," he said. Discussing the Federal Reserve's monetary policy tools, Bullard said that should the central bank determine it needs further monetary accommodation, it could decide to push back the date it expects to raise rates for the first time. Contributing to the more positive outlook, recent actions by the European Central Bank to provide liquidity to stressed financial markets through long-term financing appear to have calmed European markets, Bullard said.

Grizzlies Marc Gasol finally steps out of big brother's shadow

Credit: Reuters/Fred Thornhill By Steve Keating TORONTO | Fri Mar 2, 2012 11:43pm EST TORONTO (Reuters) - When you are seven-feet tall and a National Basketball Association (NBA) All-Star it seems inconceivable Memphis Grizzlies big man Marc Gasol would live in anyone's shadow. But when you're older brother is Pau Gasol, an NBA champion with the Los Angeles Lakers, you tend to get overlooked. Not anymore. The younger Gasol has stepped out of big brother's long shadow and into the spotlight this season, taking a leading role as the Grizzlies have clawed their way into the post-season picture collecting their seventh win in eight games with a 102-99 victory over the Toronto Raptors on Friday. "When you walk out of your big brothers shadow and they start recognizing you for your own ability, that always makes you feel good," Grizzlies coach Lionel Hollins told Reuters. "You know you've arrived. "He's made a huge step. "I think the biggest step is mentally, being more confident, being more vocal. Just taking and being the player he is suppose to be. With the Raptors' Andrea Bargnani missing his 17th game with a calf injury, Gasol contributed 21 points and five rebounds to the Grizzlies' effort. Gasol has been asked to up his game this season as the Grizzlies await for the return of injured forward Zack Randolph and the Spaniard has delivered in style averaging career highs in points (15.2), rebounds (10.1) and blocks (a franchise record 2.23 per game). "Every day, every year, he steps forwards and grows up as a player in every aspect of the game," said Raptors guard Jose Calderon, who will join Gasol on Spain's squad at this summer's London Olympics. "He can do a lot of things out there. Sometimes people don't know him yet but maybe this year people are starting to realize how good he is. "I think people here see him as a Gasol brother but for us in Spain we forget they are brothers. "They are different players, different personalities. For us he's just another guy another great player, never the brother of Pau Gasol." It would be easy for people, even fans in Memphis, to confuse the Gasol brothers. After all, Pau spent his first seven NBA seasons with the Grizzlies before being traded to the Lakers in a deal that included his younger brother going back to Memphis. But no one in Memphis is missing Pau Gasol anymore, as Marc continues to emerge as one of the key cogs on one of the NBA's best defensive and grittiest teams. "They are one of the toughest teams in the league, the way they approach the game, the way they attack the paint," Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. "They are one of the top teams in steals and creating points off turnovers. "Memphis and Miami are the two top teams, you make a mistake defensively and they will capitalize. "Their style of play is playoff style basketball. "It's not the up and down windshield wiper basketball. The game in the playoffs slows down and that favors them."

UPDATE 2-Support cited for F-35 fighter after joint meeting
| Reuters
Fri Mar 2, 2012 11:42pm EST * Countries gave program full support - sources * Meeting sponsor Canada cites "good progress" * Partners plan to make joint meeting an annual event By Andrea Shalal-Esa WASHINGTON, March 2 (Reuters) - The United States and eight other countries helping to develop the new F-35 Joint Strike Fighter underscored their full and continued support for the program, according to two sources who attended a gathering hosted by Canada. Despite U.S. plans to put off orders for 179 planes over the next five years and a steady drip of news about technical problems and developmental issues, a statement issued by Canada on Friday cited "good progress" on the program. Julian Fantino, Canada's associate minister of National Defence, hosted a dinner on Thursday and all-day meeting at his country's embassy in Washington, D.C., on Friday to improve communication among political officials from all nine partner countries. They agreed to make it an annual event. "While good progress continues to be made, we will always be vigilant with our stewardship of taxpayers' hard earned dollars," he said in a statement, adding that Canada would stick to stick to its budget for replacing its aging F-18 fighters. He said the program had already resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars of contracts for Canadian firms. The two sources said all nine countries underscored their full and continued support for what one described as the "backbone of allied defense in the free world". Lockheed Martin Corp is developing three variants of the radar-evading, supersonic fighter jet for the United States and eight countries -- Canada, Britain, Australia, Turkey, Denmark, Norway, Italy and the Netherlands. Senior U.S. officials sought to reassure the partner countries that Washington remains committed to the multinational program, and that it values their participation. The slowdown in U.S. orders and budget pressures at home have prompted some of the partners to rethink their own orders. Italy last month cut its planned buy of 131 planes by 30 percent, and others may follow suit. Privately, some foreign and even U.S. officials have expressed concern that the Pentagon's actions and tough comments from some officials are eroding support for the program despite significant strides in testing. Japan, one of the first foreign customers outside the partnership, this week said it may cancel orders for 42 F-35 fighters if the price goes up or deliveries are delayed. "Our support of this program is clear," said Pentagon spokeswoman Lieutenant Colonel Melinda Morgan. Navy Vice Admiral David Venlet, the official who manages the Pentagon's costliest weapons program, and acting acquisition chief Frank Kendall gave updates about development milestones and testing of the new warplane, as did officials from Lockheed.  PENTAGON SAYS PARTNERSHIP IS INTEGRAL "The international partnership is integral to F-35 development and we maintain strong lines of communication with the partner countries' leadership about Joint Strike Fighter development and testing," said Joe DellaVedova, spokesman for the F-35 program office. Fantino organized the meeting to facilitate greater collaboration among political officials from the nine countries funding the plane's development -- the first time so many countries have worked together to design and build a new plane. In the past, the Pentagon has provided updates to senior leaders from the partner countries only on a bilateral basis. But military officials from the nine countries already meet twice a year for review sessions. The next military-level meeting will take place March 14-15 in Australia, where the partner countries will formally update their procurement plans. "The multinational Joint Strike Fighter Program represents a new model for international cooperation," the Canadian statement said, adding that the partners agreed that "multilateral updates add purpose over bilateral discussions and updates." Fantino, a member of Canada's Conservative-led government, is under pressure from the New Democratic Party opposition to hold an open and transparent competition for the new warplanes before committing to buy 65 of the new F-35 fighter jets. "The Conservatives shouldn't be giving a blank cheque to Lockheed Martin before they know the real costs of the F-35s," Matthew Kellway, a legislator with the NDP, said in a statement. Separately, Robert Scher, deputy assistant secretary of defense for South and Southeast Asia, told reporters the issue of possible F-35 sales did not come up at all during annual U.S.-India defense policy talks held in New Delhi last month. Scher said Washington didn't need to "go on a marketing campaign," noting that "India knows full well their own needs and their own requirements and will ask us for any and every thing that they're interested in." Scher said India was looking at a range of U.S. military hardware across all of the military services, but declined to discuss any specifics. He described the defense and security realm as "one of the areas of greatest progress and promise" in the overall U.S. relationship with India.

UPDATE 3-Fed's Bullard: U.S. economic outlook is brighter

Berlian appoints advisory firm to help restructure
| Reuters
SINGAPORE, March 3 | Fri Mar 2, 2012 11:36pm EST SINGAPORE, March 3 (Reuters) - Indonesia's largest oil and gas shipping group, PT Berlian Laju Tanker, has appointed advisory firm FTI Consulting to help it restructure, the company said on Friday. Berlian, which has declared a standstill on debt repayments, also named Cos Borrelli as vice president for restructuring. His main role will be to review the firm's operations and finances and lead efforts to come to an agreement with creditors. "It is our hope that, with the assistance of the professionals we have brought in, and with our continued commitment to the process, the group will come through its current difficulties even stronger than it was before," the Indonesian firm said in a statement. Berlian said in January it was freezing payments on its debt of $2 billion while it talked to creditors about restructuring its operations and finances. Last week, the firm said it had defaulted on six of its debt instruments comprising both dollar-denominated and local currency bonds. Berlian has been hit by a slump in the oil tanker freight market made worse by the surge in oil prices. Sources have said its problems were compounded by the large debt it took on in to expand its chemical tanker business in 2007. Its shares, which are listed in both Singapore and Jakarta, have been suspended from trading since late January.

Kissing Pays Off Big as Kisstixx Secures Shark Tank Investment
| Reuters
Fri Mar 2, 2012 11:15pm EST  Kissing Pays Off Big as Kisstixx Secures Shark Tank Investment Kisstixx receives investment money and partnership with Dallas Mavericks Owner Mark Cuban Mark Cuban, billionaire Owner of the NBA World Champion Dallas Mavericks and star of ABC’s “Shark Tank,” is used to kissing trophies. Now, with his recent investment and partnership with Kisstixx, his next kiss to a trophy will provide a chemical reaction to make the experience even sweeter. In the March 2 episode of “Shark Tank,” Cuban invested $200,000 in Kisstixx, makers of a high-quality lip balm that packs a chemical reaction when kissing. Kisstixx’ lip balm comes in two compatible flavors, one for you and one for your partner. When partners kiss, the flavors combine to provide a pleasurable sensation. “Kisstixx is already a viral hit that has sold out in every test market we’ve tried. But winning the attention and partnership of Mark Cuban on ‘Shark Tank’ gives us the ammunition to make our product and company a runaway hit,” said Dallas Robinson, Kisstixx founder and CEO. “We’re growing fast and have a number of strategies to make the product more available to consumers. We’re confident the expertise and partnership we gain from Mark Cuban will create even more opportunities and open new avenues for growth.” Flavor combinations include Fire & Ice, Raspberry & Lemonade, Peaches & Cream, Pina Colada & Strawberry Daiquiri, Sweet & Sour and Strawberry & Chocolate. Flavor packs are available at www.kisstixx.com. “Shark Tank” is a reality show where entrepreneurs work to convince a panel of five tough, self-made, multi-millionaire/billionaire tycoons (“Sharks”) to part with their own hard-earned cash to give them the funding they need to jump start their businesses. About Kisstixx After years of mediocrity in the lady department, Kisstixx founders Dallas Robinson and Mike Buonomo decided to make some sweet MySpace profiles—when that didn't pay dividends they transformed their dorm rooms at Utah Valley University into makeshift chemistry labs and created Kisstixx, the best thing to happen to kissing since the French got a hold of it. With their newfound all-star level tonsil hockey skills, they are now much more popular with the ladies, and by popular we mean they don’t have to do product testing on their hands anymore.
