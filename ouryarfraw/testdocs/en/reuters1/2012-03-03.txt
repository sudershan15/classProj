Fluor Awarded Renewable Fuel Production Plant by Joule
| Reuters
Sat Mar 3, 2012 11:53pm EST  Fluor Awarded Renewable Fuel Production Plant by Joule Fluor Corporation (NYSE: FLR) announced today that it was awarded an engineering, procurement and construction management (EPCM) contract by Joule to design and build a renewable fuel production facility in New Mexico. Fluor booked the undisclosed contract value in the fourth quarter of 2011. The facility is intended to test and scale up a process for the commercial production of liquid fuels via Joule's novel technology, which uses sunlight to convert industrial waste carbon dioxide into liquid hydrocarbons, ethanol or chemical products. Joule recently won the 2011 Wall Street Journal Technology Innovation Award in the Energy category in recognition of its ability to surpass the scale, productivity and cost efficiencies of biofuel production processes. “As a leader in the engineering and construction sector, we believe that the Joule renewable fuel production facility affords Fluor an opportunity to showcase our integrated solutions and assist in the commercialization of this critical technology,” said Lou Del Tufo, Fluor’s senior vice president of Energy & Chemicals and Fluor's Biofuels business team. “We look forward to serving Joule on this project and hope to work with them as they solidify their position as one of the most innovative and forward-thinking technology companies in a rapidly growing global renewable fuels industry.” William J. Sims, president and CEO of Joule, said, “We are pleased to be working with Fluor, one of the world’s largest and most experienced EPC contractors, and we look forward to the completion and start-up of this facility as the first phase of our commercialization efforts. We fully expect to demonstrate the high efficiencies and commercial viability of our process, which, due to its modularity, can readily scale without the cost of feedstock constraints of biofuels, and ultimately lead to sustainable, localized fuel production around the world.” Fluor’s Greenville, S.C. office is leading the EPCM services project. Engineering, procurement and site mobilization are currently under way. About Joule Joule is advancing a technology platform for Liquid Fuel from the Sun™, expected to eclipse the scale, productivity and cost efficiency of any known alternative to fossil fuel today.

UPDATE 7-Rescue, cleanups continue in US tornado zone, 39 dead
| Reuters
Sat Mar 3, 2012 11:31pm EST * Twisters hit Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Alabama, Georgia * Lucky escape for 40 at Kentucky school * Insurance industry braces for heavy losses By Susan Guyett and John D. Stoll HENRYVILLE, Ind./CRITTENDEN, Ky., March 3 (Reuters) - Rescue teams and residents combed through storm-wracked towns to assess damage on Saturday from a chain of tornadoes that cut a 1,000-mile (1,600-km) swath of destruction from the Midwest to the Gulf of Mexico, as the death toll rose to at least 39 people. The fast-moving twisters spawned by massive thunderstorms splintered blocks of homes, damaged schools and a prison, and tossed around vehicles like toys, killing 20 people in Kentucky, 14 in neighboring Indiana, three in Ohio and one in Alabama, officials said. Georgia also reported a storm-related death. "We're not unfamiliar with Mother Nature's wrath out here in Indiana," Governor Mitch Daniels told CNN during a visit to the stricken southeast corner of the state. "But this is about as serious as we've seen in the years since I've been in this job," he said, standing against the backdrop of the hard-hit town of Henryville, which declared a nighttime curfew to prevent looting. Friday's storms came on top of severe weather earlier in the week in the Midwest and brought the overall death toll from the unseasonably early storms this week to at least 52 people. Tornadoes smashed Indiana and Kentucky hard, with Alabama, Georgia, Ohio and Tennessee overrun as well. President Barack Obama called the governors of Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio to offer condolences and assure them the federal government was ready to help if needed, the White House said. Television footage from some of the worst-hit towns in Indiana and Kentucky showed houses ripped from their foundations, trees downed and stripped of their foliage, and rubble scattered across wide swaths of land. In Georgia, light planes were lifted off the tarmac of a regional airport in Paulding County and thrown back on the ground. In Indiana, a school bus was slammed into a building. Tony Williams, 46, owner of the Chelsea General Store in southern Indiana, said four people died in the Chelsea area, including 4-year-old Daylin Terry Jackson and his great-grandparents, Terry and Carol Jackson, both in their late 60s. The boy and his mother, Amanda Jackson, were in a basement when the storm hit on Friday afternoon, and he was torn from her arms by the tornado. The mother survived, but her grandparents who were upstairs both died. "She was in the cellar with the boy when the tornado hit. It blew him right out of her hands," Williams said. "They found the bodies in the field outside," he added, referring to Daylin and his great-grandparents.  TODDLER HURT BUT ALIVE In one sign of hope amid the destruction, a 2-year-old girl, orphaned by the tornado, was found alive but badly hurt in a field in southeast Indiana miles from her home after a twister cut through the area, authorities said. The toddler, who remained in critical condition in a Kentucky hospital, was with members of her extended family. But her parents, a 2-month-old sister and a 3-year-old brother, were all killed, said Cis Gruebbel, a spokeswoman for Kosair Children's Hospital in Louisville. "When she was brought down here, they didn't know who she was," said Brian Rublein, another Kosair spokesman. "At last report she was in critical condition." In Henryville, birthplace of Harland David "Colonel" Sanders, who founded the Kentucky Fried Chicken fast-food chain, ground zero for the storm was a downtown complex housing an elementary, junior high and high school, where 1,400 students gather on a normal day. Nearly all them were evacuated on Friday before the tornado struck. But about 40 staff and students who were the last to leave on school buses turned back when they saw ominous signs of the approaching storm in the sky. They took shelter in an inner office in the elementary school where they rode out the tornado, even as it ripped the front off the building, leaving a dangling mess of twisted metal and insulation. Astonishingly, only one resident of the town died, according to rescue officials. "We could have been in big trouble," said Pam Horton, the elementary school treasurer. "I will never take tornado warnings lightly again." One of the school buses was flipped on its side by the storm. Another sat with its engine sheared off the chassis and its rear end embedded in the front of Budroe's restaurant, a diner across the street where other residents had taken shelter. INSURANCE LOSSES The band of tornadoes, with at least several dozen sightings and touchdowns, has already been compared to the "Super Outbreak" of twisters of April 1974, one of the largest and most violent in the United States. Friday's storms came less than a year after a series of tornadoes caused some of the worst insured losses in U.S. history, and the insurance industry is likely facing substantial costs again.. In the northern Kentucky town of Crittenden, where tornadoes ripped roofs off houses and damaged apartment blocks, low-security prisoners in orange jackets were brought in to help with clean-up efforts. In another hard-hit Kentucky town, 48-year-old carpenter Kevin Stambaugh described how he survived a twister that killed his two neighbors, who he said were found dead huddled together in their kitchen. He said he also lost 25 horses in the storm. "The Lord was looking out for me," he told Reuters outside a Baptist church in the town of Morning View, adding that wind had pushed him down the stairs to his basement and pinned him between a bar and a wall. "The windows were shattered and shards of glass were swirling around near my head." At least 300 people came to the Piner Baptist Church, advertised as a relief center, to volunteer after the storm. "Being from here, born and raised, the hardest thing is knowing that the houses I grew up seeing every day are gone. There are no words," said volunteer Amy Heeger, 38, who works for a car auction company but headed for the church to help out. In Georgia, an 83-year-old woman was found dead near a drainage pipe after she wandered from her home in severe weather on Friday, possibly to seek better shelter. A public safety official said she may have died after water rose in the pipe. Alabama authorities said 40 homes were destroyed and 150 damaged in two northern counties on Friday. One person died in a home in Tallapoosa County, an emergency official said. This week's violent storms raised fears that 2012 will be another bad year for tornadoes after 550 deaths in the United States were blamed on twisters last year, the deadliest year in nearly a century, according to the National Weather Service.

Children from Dongtang town in Renhua country were found to have "elevated" levels of lead in their blood after inhaling lead-contaminated air and eating food tainted with lead, Xinhua said. Th e natural level of lead in Dongtang is also higher than usual as the town sits on a lead-zinc ore belt which raises the lead content in the soil, Xinhua said. The report did not name the factories responsible for the lead emissions and was based on preliminary investigations that tested the blood samples of 531 residents last month. Lead poisoning is prevalent in China and has sparked protests in the past among angry parents of children hurt by heavy metal pollution. Lead is especially damaging to children as it can impede learning and affect behaviours. To counter widespread public anger, Beijing has promised to crack down on lead pollution. An industry body said last May China could shut three quarters of lead-acid battery plants in the next two or three years to cut local lead demand. China is the world's largest consumer of refined lead, with 70 percent used for making batteries. Lead poisoning builds up through regular exposure to small amounts of lead and damages the nervous and reproductive systems, kidneys, as well as causing high blood pressure and anaemia. In 2009, protesters broke into one smelting plant they blamed for the lead poisoning of more than 600 children, smashing trucks and tearing down fences before the police stopped them.

Ron the Greek wins Santa Anita Handicap
| Reuters
Sat Mar 3, 2012 11:21pm EST (Reuters) - Ron the Greek, ridden by Jose Lezcano, wore down Setsuko in the final furlong to win the $750,000 Santa Anita Handicap by three-and-a-half lengths on Saturday. Setsuko finished second out of the 13 entrants, a half-length in front of Uh Oh Bango in the mile-and-a-quarter race at Santa Anita Park. "At the half-mile pole I had a lot of horse, but I had to keep asking my horse," said Lezcano. "My horse is like a bicycle, you keep asking and he will keep running." Florida-bred Ron the Greek, trained by Bill Mott, has won six of 17 career starts. Setsuko trainer Richard Mandella said his horse "ran a good race" but did not have the firepower of Ron the Greek. "There wasn't much question," Mandella said. "The winner was just too good."

Fourteen killed in Polish head-on train collision
| Reuters
By Janusz and Chmielewski SZCZECHOCINY, Poland, March 4 | Sat Mar 3, 2012 10:30pm EST SZCZECHOCINY, Poland, March 4 (Reuters) - At least 14 people were killed when two passenger trains collided head-on in southern Poland late on Saturday in one of the country's worst train crashes in more than 20 years. The two trains carrying an estimated 350 passengers were heading in opposite directions on the same track when they crashed at high speed in a rural area near the town of Szczechociny. At least 54 people were injured. One of the green-and-cream coloured carriages of an intercity train traveling to Warsaw had jack-knifed upwards from the force of the crash. Other cars had derailed and were lying on their sides. "This certainly is the most tragic train catastrophe in our history in many, many years," said Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who arrived at the site of the crash with several other government officials early on Sunday. "At the moment we cannot with full responsibility give the final number of fatalities. We should expect at least 14, but we fear this number could rise to 15," he added. Tusk said it was too early to speculate about the cause of the collision, but added that human error could not be excluded. The fate of the two drivers was not immediately known as the authorities were still identifying the dead bodies More than 350 firefighters rushed to the scene, but had to carry their equipment by hand because the trains collided in the middle of a field crossed only by the train tracks. With the aid of a sniffer dog, rescue workers continued to search for other victims in the mass of mangled steel, where Tusk said they found at least one additional body, most likely dead. "I felt the blow," an unnamed survivor told public television. "I hit the person before me. The lights went out. Everything flew. We flew over the compartment like bags. We could hear screams. We prayed." The injured were transported to nearby hospitals. Among the passangers were several Ukrainians along with French and Spanish citizens, but none of them were hospitalised. One of the trains had been going from Warsaw from to the town of Krakow and the other from the Polish capital to the town of Przemysl.
