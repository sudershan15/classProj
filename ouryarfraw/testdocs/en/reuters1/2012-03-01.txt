Text:Origin, Conoco raise $2.6 bln loans for Australia-Pacific LNG project
| Reuters
Thu Mar 1, 2012 11:56pm EST SYDNEY, March 2 (Basis Point) - Thirteen lenders have committed between $100-350 million each to a $2.625 billion project financing to fund the development of Origin Energy Ltd and ConocoPhillips' Australia Pacific liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Queensland, banking sources said. Origin and Conoco approved the $14 billion first phase of their 9 million tonnes a year project, Australia Pacific LNG Pty Ltd, in July 2011. They are expected to approve the second phase this quarter, after China's Sinopec agreed to increase its stake in the project to 25 percent and buy more gas. The lenders and their commitment amounts are: ANZ ($350 million), Export Development Canada ($300 million), Commonwealth Bank of Australia ($250 million),National Australia Bank ($250 million), Mizuho Corporate Bank ($250 million), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp ($250 million), HSBC ($200 million), Westpac Banking Corp ($200 million), Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ ($150 million), BOS International Australia ($125 million), DNB Bank ($100 million), DBS Bank ($100 million) and SG ($100 million). However, there is still the possibility some Chinese lenders may join the deal before it reaches financial close in a couple of months, sources said. Despite tough market conditions, the final loan amount raised was slightly higher than the original target of $2.5 billion, underscoring strong bank appetite for oil and gas projects as well as the strength of the sponsors, the sources said.  LOAN MARGIN The margin starts at 250 basis points over Libor during the four-year construction period, with the sponsors Origin and ConocoPhillips guaranteeing the construction. The sponsors' guarantee falls away during the 16-year operational phase, and accordingly the margin increases over time to reflect the higher risk profile, starting at 275bp over Libor for years 1-8, climbing to 300bp over Libor in years 9-12, and 325bp in years 13-16. The participation fee is a flat 200bp. The loan is moving into the documentation phase and funding is expected to start in the middle of the year after the sponsors give the final investment nod, according to sources. In addition to commercial bank debt, the sponsors and financial adviser are also finalising direct loans with export credit agencies China Export & Credit Insurance and US Exim, with each ECA providing a loan similar in size to the commercial loan tranche, one of the sources added. RBS is advising on the deal.

State radio reported polling stations opened their doors to voters at 8 a.m. (0430 GMT). They are due to close at 6 p.m. (1430 GMT), although this time has been extended in past votes. The parliamentary vote is expected to reflect a deepening power struggle between political and religious hardliners. With marginalized reformists not involved, loyalists of Iran's most powerful figure, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, are set to block backers of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad from winning a majority in the 290-seat assembly. The election result will have a bearing on the presidential election in 2013. The parliamentary election will have no impact on Tehran's nuclear row with the West and its foreign affairs, since these are very much in the hands of Khamenei. Some 48.2 million Iranians are eligible to vote out of the population of 74 million.

Arizona sheriff says Obama's birth certificate a forgery

Most Republican critics of Obama have given up pursuing such widely discredited "birther" allegations. But the investigation by Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, carried out by what he described as five-member volunteer "posse," was prompted by a request last August from a group of conservative Tea Party activists in the Phoenix area. The White House has denied repeated claims that Obama was not born in the United States. In April 2011, Obama released a longer version of his birth certificate to try to put to rest speculation within some Republican circles that he was not born in the country as required by the U.S. Constitution to become president. "A 6-month-long investigation conducted by my cold case posse has led me to believe there is probably cause to believe that President Barack Obama's long-form birth certificate ... is a computer-generated fraud," Arpaio told a news conference. Arizona Democratic Party finance director Dan Mitchell later sent out an email seeking to parlay the sheriff's charges into cash donations for the party. "Stop the ridiculous Tea Party, birther, GOP nonsense, click here to make a donation to the Democratic Party now," the message read. Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt poked fun at Arpaio on Twitter, providing what he described as a link to a video feed of the news conference that instead directed readers to the opening credits of "The X-Files," a TV show about paranormal activity. Arpaio, a conservative Republican who styles himself as "America's toughest sheriff," called for the U.S. Congress to investigate his findings, which concluded that forgers committed two crimes, first in creating a fraudulent document and then in fraudulently presenting it to the public. "I want to make this perfectly clear. I am not accusing the sitting president of the United States of committing a crime. But there remain a lot of questions which beg for answers and we intend to move forward with this investigation in pursuit of those answers," Arpaio said. Arpaio's accusations come as he undergoes investigation by the U.S. Justice Department over what it says is his widespread discrimination against Latinos. In December, the Justice Department said Arpaio and his deputies violated U.S. civil rights laws by engaging in racial profiling of Latinos and making unlawful arrests in their bid to crack down on illegal immigrants. Arpaio told reporters on Thursday his review of Obama's birth certificate began in August, months before the Justice Department investigation findings in December, and denied that it was politically motivated. (Additional reporting by David Schwartz; Editing by Cynthia Johnston and Eric Walsh)  If they fail to begin to do their job – which is to arrest Obama, they have committed a felony themselves: Misprision of a Felony Whoever, having knowledge of the actual commission of a felony cognizable by a court of the United States, conceals and does not as soon as possible make known the same to some judge or other person in civil or military authority under the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.  And IMO, I think the whole controversy was created by the Obama 2008 campaign to tweak republicans. There may be much to hide and what better way to hide it by getting ppl fixated on something much more minor. And I think the fact that the birth certificate seems to not hide the fact that it’s faked is another ploy.It’s interesting to note that NO ONE of note has come out and said that they believe it’s authentic.Just like no Official in the Obama Admin has verified that they’ve seen and verified the death pics of OsamaBinLaden. The trick is not not so much listen to what “they” are saying but what “they” are NOT saying.

World clippers raise the baa in NZ for shear fun of it
| Reuters
Our photographers sometimes capture moments that are strange and offbeat. Here's a recent sampling.  Slideshow  By Naomi Tajitsu WELLINGTON | Thu Mar 1, 2012 11:45pm EST WELLINGTON (Reuters) - For lucky sheep, it's like a trip to the hair salon. For the unlucky ones, it can resemble a wild and woolly wrestling match against an opponent armed with a sharp object. The 4,600 sheep picked for the 2012 World Sheep Shearing Competition in Masterton, New Zealand, and the national Golden Shears championships are in for a pampering this week, when top clippers from around the globe compete for a top prize of NZ$3,000 ($2,500). The return of the biennial event to New Zealand for the first time since 1996 is seen as a homecoming by the sheep-shearing community. That's not surprising in a nation where sheep outnumber humans 10 to one and which this year lobbied for sheep shearing to be recognized as an Olympic sport. "People here say the Golden Shears is the Wimbledon of sheep shearing," said Doug Laing, media officer at Shearing Sports New Zealand. Shearers from heavyweight countries New Zealand, Australia and Britain are competing with entries from lesser-known shearing countries, including Germany, Estonia and Japan. They will be judged on speed and accuracy in both machine and hand-blade cutting categories. Penalty points are given according to how long each shearing takes, as well as "imperfections" that include nicks and cuts to the sheep and double cutting. Laing, a descendant of a shearing family, says nimbleness with the "blades" -- a colloquial term for manual and electric shears -- and getting the sheep positioned correctly are the key components of a close, comfortable shave. "Once you've got the sheep's balance sorted, and you've got them seated all right, it's just like giving them a haircut," Laing said. Best results are also achieved by following the "Bowen style" favored in New Zealand. Developed in the 1950s by a famed pair of shearing brothers named Godfrey and Ivan Bowen, the sheep is shorn in rhythmical sweeps while pulling the skin away from the body. "Otherwise it ends up looking like a wrestling match," Laing said. Local shearer John Kirkpatrick, a three-time Golden Shears champion, is tipped to take the top machine-shearing prize at both the World Championships and the national Golden Shears competition. Kirkpatrick, however, is expected to face stiff competition from compatriot Cam Ferguson in Saturday's finals. Ferguson holds the world record for shearing longwool lambs -- a whopping 742 in eight hours.

Senator Snowe's retirement causes chaos in Maine

See the best of Reuters photography.  See more | Photo caption  A look at the legal battles and the controversies over gay marriage.  Slideshow  Peru declares a health alert after hundreds of birds and dolphins wash up dead in the past few months.  Slideshow  By Jason McLure Thu Mar 1, 2012 11:44pm EST (Reuters) - Senator Olympia Snowe's decision to not seek re-election in November has roiled politics in Maine with both of the state's U.S. House members and at least two former governors considering runs for her seat. Snowe, a popular pro-choice Republican in her 18th year in the Senate after 16 years in the House, was expected to easily win another term but stunned politicians and the public alike with a Tuesday announcement she would bow out, citing an "atmosphere of polarization" in Congress. "Olympia Snowe was like a giant dam holding back the waters of Maine politics," said Greg Olson, campaign manager for Democratic Maine Congressman Michael Michaud. "Now it's like a flood with water flowing all over the place." Michaud, Representative Chellie Pingree and former Governor John Baldacci have all begun petitions to put their names on the Democratic ballot. Maine Senate President Kevin Raye, a former chief of staff to Snowe, is seen as the favorite on the Republican side if he chooses to drop his bid for Michaud's seat in the U.S. House. Two independents, Eliot Cutler, who narrowly lost a three-way gubernatorial battle in 2010 to Republican Governor Paul LePage, and former Governor Angus King are also considering bids. Accelerating the scramble is a March 15 deadline for Republican and Democratic candidates to submit 2,000 signatures. Independents have until June. Some of the major figures are likely to take themselves out of the race by then, said L. Sandy Maisel, a professor of government at Colby College in Waterville, Maine. "It's very chaotic but I think it will shake out by the middle of next week," Maisel said, adding that Snowe's late announcement may have been designed to help Raye on the Republican side. Raye, the president of the state senate and owner of an Eastport mustard company, spent 17 years on Snowe's congressional staff and was mounting a strong bid for Michaud's seat. State Treasurer Bruce Poliquin and Secretary of State Charles E. Summers Jr. are also considered Republican possibilities. Pingree, a liberal favorite who is married to hedge fund magnate S. Donald Sussman, would have an edge in fundraising and could have an advantage in a state with a tradition of electing female U.S. senators. Former Senator Margaret Chase Smith represented Maine for 24 years until 1973 and was the longest-serving woman in the history of the body until Maryland Senator Barbara Mikulski broke the record last month. Pingree ran for U.S. Senate unsuccessfully in 2002 against Republican Senator Susan Collins. Michaud, a former paper mill worker, represents the state's impoverished second district, a 27,000 square mile expanse that stretches from the state's northern border with New Brunswick to the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Baldacci, now President Obama's military healthcare czar, was governor from 2003 until last January but left office with polls showing less than 40 percent approved of his performance. Voter turnout in Maine was already expected to be high in November as the ballot will include a referendum on legalizing same-sex marriage in the state. Separately, in an editorial for the Washington Post on Thursday, Snowe elaborated on her reasons for leaving, saying that in her life after the Senate she sees a critical need to "engender public support for the political center." She said she would work to reform the Senate from outside the institution. (Additional reporting by Lily Kuo.

Durant inspires late Thunder rally past Magic
| Reuters
Thu Mar 1, 2012 11:42pm EST (Reuters) - Kevin Durant led the league-leading Thunder to a seventh consecutive victory as Oklahoma City used an explosive fourth-quarter charge to rally for a 105-102 road victory over the Orlando Magic on Thursday. Durant scored 18 of his game-high 38 points in the final quarter at the Amway Center to help the Thunder (29-7) overcome a 14-point deficit. The forward sank two free throws with four minutes remaining to give the Thunder their first lead since the opening quarter (90-89) and then added 10 more points to protect the advantage. The Magic (23-14) used a 21-10 run to extend a 53-50 halftime lead into a 14 point cushion at the start of the third quarter, led by Dwight Howard, who finished the game with 33 points and nine rebounds. Russell Westbrook added 29 points for the Thunder and had 10 assists, while James Harden scored 13 points off the bench.

U.S. NATO ambassador says Afghan policy intact

"What happened in the last few days are the kinds of thing which we condemn, that are unacceptable," Ivo Daalder told reporters after a speech to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. "But we can't have a few situations, which are tragic, ... be the determining factor in our policy. We think we have the right policy. We're determined to see it through," he said. Speaking in Chicago where NATO will hold its annual summit on May 21, Daalder said leaders of the 28-member alliance will discuss the next phase of the transition to Afghan-led security. Western officials have been hoping the violent outcry that erupted last week in Afghanistan following the burning of copies of the Koran at a NATO military base will soon pass, allowing them to focus on the other major challenges that remain before most foreign combat troops are due to leave Afghanistan at the end of 2014. The killing of the U.S. officers in the Interior Ministry on Saturday stunned NATO and cast doubt on its strategy of replacing large combat units with advisers as the alliance tries to wind down the war, now in its 11th year. NATO immediately moved to withdraw all its advisers from Afghan ministries in Kabul. Britain, Germany and Canada then withdrew their advisers. Some NATO staff have been allowed to go back to the ministries. Separately, Daalder was asked about what NATO uses as criteria for intervening militarily, such as in Libya last year and why it is not doing so now in violence-torn Syria. Daalder said there were three conditions, and Syria certainly met the first one of a humanitarian need but offered that there was neither regional support nor a legal basis for intervening. He cited Russia and China blocking United Nations Security Council resolutions on Syria. "Frankly, I doubt we'd get to the point that we'd have that basis (to intervene in Syria)," he said. Another topic to be discussed at the upcoming NATO summit will be the capability and deployment of a missile defense system to guard Europe from a growing ballistic missile threat, Daalder said, citing an unspecified threat from the Middle East that many in the audience understood referred to Iran. Russia has protested NATO's plan to position missile interceptors in Romania and Poland, but Daalder said there were ongoing discussions to try to allay those concerns. "(The missile defense system) will be decided upon and implemented not in order to threaten Russia but in order to strengthen the security of Europe," he said, calling Russia an ally and friend with whom one sometimes disagrees.
